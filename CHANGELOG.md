# Fusion changelog

User-facing release notes aggregated across all packages. This file is auto-synced from each `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` by `scripts/release.mjs` — do not edit by hand.

## 0.76.0

### Highlights

- Workflow stages now run on durable role agents; the ephemeral-agent setting is removed
- Fixed the deadlocks that left tasks stuck in progress with no session and no error
- Fixed a boot hang where spec-drift reconciliation exhausted the database connection pool
- Reviews block only on high-priority findings, cutting repeated plan and code review fix rounds
- Durable project memory: recall records, Memory Keeper consolidation, and MCP memory tools

### Breaking

- The retired ephemeral-agent compatibility setting and its Settings control are removed; stale values are discarded on read and update.
- Deprecated v0 mission resume blockers are removed in favor of canonical blocker descriptors.

### New

- Workflow stages route through durable multi-role agents instead of ephemeral workers; existing singular role input stays migration-compatible.
- Reviews gate on finding severity: new per-workflow Plan Review (default high) and Code Review (default critical) blocking thresholds. Set either to `any` to restore the old behavior where every REVISE blocks. Non-blocking findings land in PROMPT.md as Review Advisory Notes.
- Durable project recall for decisions, preferences, and solutions, plus a Memory Keeper agent for knowledge-graph and recall consolidation, provenance-tagged memory semantics, automatic recall capture, and Fusion memory tools through the built-in MCP server. Every agent lane is steered to search memory first, and Agent Detail shows consolidation history.
- Live agent activity: durable org-wide history with a live stream, a live activity and handoff flow in the Agents view, and a Command Center activity timeline with scroll-back.
- Plan Review can now close stale or duplicate work before implementation starts.
- Approved plans are preserved with immutable spec-lock, current-plan evidence, and deterministic execution drift reports.
- Require named GitHub checks before Fusion merges pull requests, plus opt-in GitHub-native pull request auto-merge and signed GitHub CI signal ingestion that updates merge checks without waiting for polling.
- Completed tasks now produce recommendations with guarded one-click task creation, a project-wide Insights surface, and optional mailbox notices.
- macOS: `fn computer` adds desktop-app discovery, snapshots, actions, and permission reporting, with a version-matched computer-use agent skill that runtime sessions discover automatically.
- Mission management: reconcile feature state from delivery task ground truth, a "Reconcile now" control with dry-run preview, agent tools to set mission and feature status with attributed audit events, clear and re-run controls for repairable validation badges, and an operator-only tool to clear a stale mission blocked badge.
- Mailbox gains structural reports, inline approvals, chat-to-report handoff, roadmap-item attachments that open in Roadmaps, archive and restore for messages and conversations, and approvals raised during planning.
- Planning a GitHub issue creates a task linked to that issue, and can import issue and comment screenshots.
- New operator tool `fn_workflow_step_resume` unsticks permanently-pending merge review steps.
- `fn knowledge-graph build` generates a committable code knowledge graph.
- Managers can review and coach evaluation results for agents in their reporting tree.
- Grok 4.6 is available in every model picker, and the bundled Pi runtime moves to 0.84.1.
- Português (Brasil) joins the dashboard and terminal UI languages.

### Fixed

- Tasks no longer stall indefinitely in progress with no session after the workflow role-agent rollout: built-in role agents are routable again, continuation writes are atomic, and principal holds back off from 15s to 5m instead of re-dispatching about 3.5 times a second.
- Queued tasks now start once the board frees up; capacity-parked continuations were owned by no drain and sat runnable forever.
- Planned tasks no longer sit roughly 10 minutes in Todo before Plan Review starts.
- Planning failures retry with 60s/120s/300s backoff and park after 3 attempts instead of looping every poll; provider request timeouts now route into that same bounded policy, and a new planning timeout caps a hung planning turn.
- The Plan Review replan cap setting is now actually read; lowering it takes effect, and `0` parks on the first REVISE.
- Fixed "Failed to create chat session" on model chats, and tasks wrongly failed as branch conflicts when their branch was already merged.
- Fixed CLI commands aborting mid-command on Node 22.4+ so `fn init` completes.
- Fixed Grok ACP startup by making `--no-auto-update` opt-in for Grok CLI v1.0.0.
- Tunnels restart automatically with backoff after crashing instead of staying failed until manually restarted.
- The Todo Lists and Roadmaps plugins now appear in navigation after being enabled.
- Operator-owned external checkouts stay authoritative across recovery, remediation, verification, and cleanup, and Fusion no longer modifies or deletes them; routing without a checkout path fails closed.
- A stale worktree base no longer fails a task: declined refreshes are recorded and execution continues, reacquired worktrees refresh against the current integration branch, and fresh worktrees rebase onto the configured integration branch.
- Retained but inactive worktrees no longer exhaust live task capacity, and workflow principal session caps are removed with a sweep that re-queues continuations stranded in running or held.
- Pull requests: no auto-merge for branch-protected, behind, conflicting, or unknown states; branch-protection blocks are reported as policy blocks rather than false conflicts; retries honor persisted backoff and pause for operator action; PR heads are refreshed before create and merge.
- Alerts are quieter and more honest: no "needs operator action" for tasks running normally or intentionally held, terminal-failure alerts wait for automatic recovery to fail first, and generic terminal failures retry on a durable budget before escalating.
- Reviewer verdicts and findings survive review prose containing stray braces, and resolved findings stay visible without allowing no-op revision requests.
- Board and task detail: stale Planning badges clear, the In progress badge is restored, Promote is hidden while a task is planning or held on plan review and approval, and Promote appears on every card the server would actually release. Task cards distinguish the assigned agent from the creating agent, PR and review updates stay visible, and an empty Activity Feed refetches on open.
- Planning Mode keeps running when browser storage is unavailable, shows four distinct responses plus a write-your-own choice, and offers a context-appropriate 3-5 option set.
- Quick Add: the model dropdown filter box narrows the list as you type, the collapse/expand toggle works, the merger row is labeled "Merger", and action buttons center on desktop with edge-to-edge spacing at tablet widths.
- Every open dashboard stays in sync when a task is paused or unpaused, and the model list no longer hangs when a provider catalog stalls.
- Missions: reconciliation no longer fails every cycle, paused missions stay paused through status roll-up, duplicate manual validation runs are prevented, automatic validation waits for in-flight manual runs, and merge behavior plus read-only shared branch status are clearer.
- Shared PostgreSQL isolation: durable agent data, agent ratings, custom workflows, chat data, approval audit history, verification-cache results, and project records are scoped to the active project.
- Recommendations capture and display are restored, including an empty result state and a tab shown only when the completed task has records.
- Execution retries after the first terminal tool-call failure by default, partially completed tasks resume after restart without a false failure, and canceled AI merge bodies can no longer overwrite successor merge state.
- Settings history now records every change with truthful provenance, engine heartbeat churn no longer floods it, and revision APIs support paging.
- The Agents Overview active-agent list scrolls on mobile, Messages structure selection fits narrow composers, and terminal pin and pop-out toggles moved to the top toolbar.
- Restored missing localized merge, notification, recommendation, settings, and required-check copy across locales.

### Performance

- Scheduler hold-release sweeps and health probes stay responsive under PostgreSQL load via batched workflow-selection reads, a pass-scoped cache, per-project sweep guard, and sweep and probe deadlines.
- The engine log no longer repeats dispatch-blocked and symbol-lock-loss lines every poll for a stuck task.

### Internal

- Eight project-owned storage tables now model their partition identities.
- Plugin hot reload no longer leaves scratch files in plugin folders.
- The published CLI manifest declares TypeScript once as a runtime dependency.

## 0.76.0-beta.3

### Highlights

- Planned tasks no longer stall ~10 minutes in Todo before Plan Review starts
- Insights adds project-wide task recommendations with paginated triage
- Mailbox notices arrive for captured task recommendations, via a new project setting
- Merge, notification, recommendation, and settings copy is localized again in six locales
- Terminal pin and pop-out toggles moved to the top toolbar, left of the close button

### New

- Insights now has a project-wide task recommendations surface, backed by a bounded row-paginated API.
- Captured task recommendations can send mailbox notices, controlled by the new `recommendationMailboxNoticeEnabled` project setting.

### Fixed

- Planned tasks that sat roughly ten minutes in Todo now move into Plan Review promptly: the planning-to-plan-review handoff retires its predecessor and installs the successor in a single transaction, and the follow-up reaction retries instead of dropping failures silently.
- Localized merge, notification, recommendation, and settings copy is restored across six locales, and a stale pt-BR settings key was removed.
- Terminal pin and pop-out toggles now sit in the top toolbar to the left of the close button.
- The Quick Add composer's bottom row of action buttons is centered again, with the ≤768px layout unchanged.
- Quick Add buttons use mobile edge-to-edge spacing on tablet widths (769px–1024px).

## 0.76.0-beta.2

### Highlights

- Verification cache, approval audit, and GitHub check state now stay scoped per project
- Grok 4.6 available in every model picker, on bundled Pi runtime 0.84.1
- Quick Add model dropdown: typing filters, collapse toggle works, merger row labeled Merger
- Mission reconciliation no longer fails every cycle with a scheduler error
- Archive and restore mailbox messages and chat conversations from the dashboard

### New

- Grok 4.6 is registered in the built-in Grok catalog and appears in every model picker.
- Mailbox messages and chat conversations can be archived and restored from dedicated views.
- Managers can review and coach evaluation results for agents in their reporting tree.

### Fixed

- Verification-cache results and project records are isolated per project instead of shared across them.
- Approval audit history is scoped to the active project.
- PostgreSQL GitHub check-state ownership defaults are reconciled during upgrades.
- Typing in the Quick Add model dropdown filter box narrows the model list again.
- The collapse/expand toggle in model selection dropdowns no longer closes the dropdown.
- The Quick Add model menu labels the merger row "Merger" with spacing matching the other roles.
- The task Recommendations tab appears only when a completed task actually has recommendations.
- Mission reconciliation no longer fails every cycle with an internal scheduler error.

### Internal

- The bundled Pi runtime moves from 0.82.1 to 0.84.1 for updated provider and model support.
- Eight project-owned storage tables are modeled with their partition identities.

## 0.76.0-beta.1

### Highlights

- Breaking: the retired ephemeralAgentsEnabled setting and v0 mission resume blockers are gone
- Fixes the deadlock that left every task stuck: built-in workflow agents were unroutable
- Fusion no longer hangs on startup when a project has 1,000+ tasks
- Reviews block only on high-priority findings, cutting repeat plan and code review rounds
- Durable project memory: recall, Memory Keeper consolidation, and MCP memory tools

### Breaking

- Removed the retired ephemeral-agent compatibility setting and its control; stale values are discarded on settings read and update.
- Removed the deprecated v0 mission resume blockers in favor of canonical blocker descriptors, which now deduplicate per root feature, source, and reason.

### New

- Durable project recall for decisions, preferences, and solutions, plus the Memory Keeper agent that consolidates the knowledge graph on a schedule and shows its consolidation history in Agent Detail.
- Fusion memory tools exposed through the built-in MCP server, with provenance-tagged memory semantics and automatic recall capture from task, research, and insight sources.
- Every agent lane is steered to search memory before starting work.
- Live agent activity: a durable org-wide history and stream, a live activity and handoff view in Agents, and a Command Center timeline you can scroll back through.
- Reviews now block only on high-priority findings. New per-workflow settings control the blocking threshold (plan review defaults to high, code review to critical); set either to "any" to restore blocking on every REVISE. Non-blocking findings land in the spec as review advisory notes.
- Plan Review can close stale or duplicate work before implementation starts, and approved plans are locked with deterministic execution drift reporting.
- Opt-in GitHub-native pull request auto-merge, required named GitHub checks before Fusion merges, and signed GitHub CI signal ingestion so verified check results update merge gates without waiting for polling.
- Route task execution and review through one validated external Git checkout that Fusion never modifies or deletes.
- macOS computer use: `fn computer` for desktop app discovery, snapshots, actions, and permission reporting, a version-matched computer-use agent skill, and automatic skill discovery in macOS runtime sessions.
- Mission management gains a "Reconcile now" control with dry-run preview, automatic reconciliation from delivery task ground truth, agent tools to set mission and feature status with attributed audit events, and operator controls to clear stale blocked badges and re-run repairable validations.
- Planning a GitHub issue creates a task linked to that issue as a tracked source, and Planning Mode can import issue and comment screenshots.
- Agent mail gains structural reports, inline approvals, chat-to-report handoff, roadmap items you can drag in and open in Roadmaps, and approvals raised during planning.
- `fn knowledge-graph build` generates a committable code knowledge graph.
- Português (Brasil) is available as a dashboard, terminal UI, and translation target language.

### Fixed

- Tasks no longer spin against unroutable built-in workflow agents; a principal hold now backs off from 15s to 5m instead of re-dispatching about 3.5 times a second and writing roughly 19k audit rows an hour with nothing executing.
- Queued tasks start again after the board fills up: continuations parked by capacity are picked up by the drain instead of sitting runnable with no state change.
- Four other long stalls fixed, covering principal routing, dependency auto-unblock clearing a needs-replan signal, stranded planning holds, and unbounded workflow run ids.
- Stranded workflow continuations left running or held are re-queued automatically, and workflow principal session caps are removed.
- Startup no longer wedges on "starting": spec-drift reconciliation is bounded to 4 concurrent reconciles with backoff, so a 1,082-task project opens 3-10 database connections during boot instead of saturating the cluster.
- Planning failures retry with 60s/120s/300s backoff and park after 3 attempts instead of looping forever, and a new planning turn timeout (default 90 minutes) bounds hung sessions.
- Provider request timeouts are treated as transient and retried with backoff instead of re-admitting the card every poll.
- The Plan Review replan cap setting is now actually read; lowering it takes effect, with a default of 15 and 0 parking on the first REVISE.
- A stale worktree base no longer fails a task: a declined refresh holds the task instead of blocking execution, and reacquired worktrees are refreshed against the current integration branch.
- Reacquired and fresh worktrees rebase onto the configured integration branch, task-pinned worktrees recover when an incomplete directory occupies their path, and worktree conflict cleanup no longer crashes before its active-session safety check.
- Tasks are no longer failed as branch conflicts when their branch was already merged, and "Failed to create chat session" on model chats is fixed.
- Auto-merge no longer attempts branch-protected, behind, conflicting, or unknown pull requests; branch-protection blocks are reported honestly and pause for operator action instead of surfacing as merge conflicts.
- Automated pull request heads are refreshed before creation and merge, timed-out merges recover without stale status blocking retries, and canceled AI merge bodies cannot overwrite successor merge state.
- "Needs operator action" alerts no longer fire for tasks that are running normally or intentionally held; terminal failures retry automatically first and alerts wait out a settle window.
- Promote appears only on cards the server would actually release: hidden while a task is still being planned or blocked on plan review and approval holds.
- Completed tasks always show a Recommendations tab, including an empty state, and executors are prompted to produce those recommendations again after a refactor dropped the request.
- Activity Log records every settings change rather than four keys, with redaction, honest provenance for API and system writes, engine heartbeat noise excluded, and paging on the revision API.
- Durable agent data, agent ratings, custom workflows, and project-bound workflow and chat data stay isolated per project on shared PostgreSQL.
- Grok ACP starts again with released Grok CLI v1.0.0 by making --no-auto-update opt-in.
- CLI commands no longer abort mid-command on Node 22.4+, so `fn init` completes; Node >=22.4.0 is now declared.
- Tunnels restart automatically with backoff after a crash instead of staying failed until manually restarted.
- Reviewer verdicts and findings survive review prose containing stray braces, and resolved findings stay visible without allowing no-op revision requests.
- The engine log stops repeating dispatch-blocked and symbol-lock-loss lines every poll for a stuck task.
- The model list no longer hangs when a provider catalog stalls.
- Chat attachment thumbnails clear as soon as the message is accepted.
- Task cards distinguish the assigned agent from the agent that created the task.
- The Agents Overview active agents list scrolls on mobile instead of clipping.
- Newly created tasks get an eligible executor owner automatically, and explicit engineer and operator-override assignment works again in CLI tools.
- Mission fixes: planned follow-ups resume after their source task completes, paused missions stay paused through status roll-up, duplicate manual validation runs are prevented, and automatic validation waits for an in-flight manual run.
- Pull request and review updates stay visible in open task details.
- Plan writes no longer fail permanently after a plan-evidence version collision, and approved plans stay accurate when parent lineage is removed.
- Duplicate redirects are recognized in task titles and with custom task prefixes, and duplicate conflict responses are restored for ordinary intake.
- Plan-review replan and review fix handoffs work again in projects with auto-merge off, including shared-branch tasks.
- Direct DATABASE_URL connections can finalize planning lifecycle locks.
- Required pull-request check settings labels are available in every dashboard locale.

### Performance

- Scheduler hold-release sweeps and health probes stay responsive under PostgreSQL load through batched workflow-selection reads, a per-project sweep guard, and sweep and probe deadlines.

### Internal

- Plugin hot reload no longer leaves scratch files behind in plugin folders.
- The published CLI manifest declares TypeScript once, as a runtime dependency.

## 0.76.0-beta.0

### Highlights

- Workflow stages now run on durable multi-role agents instead of ephemeral workers
- Dashboard no longer freezes on a startup connection-pool deadlock
- Tasks no longer stall in progress with no session after the role-agent rollout
- Completed tasks can suggest follow-ups with guarded one-click creation
- New fn_workflow_step_resume unsticks merge review steps stuck pending forever

### New

- Workflow stages are routed through durable multi-role agents rather than ephemeral workflow workers. Existing single-role configuration keeps working.
- Completed tasks now produce recommendations you can turn into new tasks in one click. The project setting `maxRecommendationsPerTask` caps how many you can accept.
- `fn_workflow_step_resume` is a new operator-only CLI and pi-extension tool that moves a permanently-pending pre-merge review step to failed, so `fn_task_bypass_review` can clear the merge blocker. Every resume is audit-logged.

### Fixed

- The dashboard could stop answering every request at startup because built-in role-agent provisioning held a lock while waiting on a second connection from a three-connection pool. It now runs on the locking transaction.
- Tasks could sit in progress forever with no session after the role-agent rollout, caused by two silent deadlocks in role routing and durable continuation writes. Suspended runs are now recorded in the run audit instead of vanishing.
- Extension-host task stores are warmed for every registered project at dashboard startup, so `fn_task_*` tools no longer risk a timeout booting a second connection pool.
- Pausing or unpausing a task now propagates to every open dashboard.
- Stale Planning badges clear once refreshed task state shows execution has moved on, without erasing newer planner activity.
- The In progress badge is back on active tasks that have no transient status, across board and list views.
- An empty task Activity Feed now refetches when you open it after execution has already started.
- Partially completed tasks resume after a restart instead of reporting a false failure.
- Verified no-op tasks no longer bounce repeatedly between lifecycle states.
- Execution retries once after the first terminal tool-call failure by default; the project threshold stays configurable and existing overrides are preserved.
- Planning Mode keeps working when browser storage is unavailable, evicting only its own key and retrying once.
- Planning Mode shows four distinct responses plus a write-your-own choice, and prompts now guide 3-5 alternatives without truncating larger valid option sets.
- Messages structure selection stays inside narrow mobile composers in both full-page and modal Messages.
- Inactive retained worktrees no longer eat live task capacity; worktree admission is shared across execution, planning, merge, and workflow continuation lanes.
- Shared branch-group members honor project auto-merge consent, and review advisories appear before promotion.
- Mission autopilot slice progression stays serial and milestone ordered even with duplicate completion or recovery signals.
- Mission detail explains merge behavior and shows read-only shared branch status, validating branch-group ownership before displaying branch, member, and PR data.
- Secrets environment fingerprint records stay out of task worktrees.
- The legacy agent setting no longer influences mission or workflow routing.
- Built-in workflow agents get detailed identities backfilled non-destructively, with duplicate provenance reconciled.
- Settings now states the enabled default for the ephemeral-agent compatibility setting.
- The Todo Lists and Roadmaps plugins appear in dashboard navigation once enabled.

## 0.75.1

### Highlights

- Secrets now bind to the selected project, work in chat approvals, and land in new worktrees
- Approving a task plan resumes Plan Review automatically
- Pick individual structured review findings to send back for same-task revision
- No failure alerts while Fusion is still auto-recovering the task
- Dashboard cards refresh reliably after unpause, tab resume, and SSE reconnect

### New

- Select individual structured workflow review findings and send just those back for a same-task revision, with location and severity preserved.
- Custom workflow review nodes are now classified as plan or code review, so their results accept feedback directly from the Review tab.

### Fixed

- Dashboard secret management is bound to the selected project; requests without an explicit project are rejected rather than resolved from fallback context.
- Chat-agent secret approvals work again, and failed decisions now show an actionable reason.
- Secrets env files are restored in fresh task worktrees.
- Approving a task plan hands off to the engine so Plan Review resumes on its own instead of stalling.
- Workflow review feedback selection works again for same-task revisions.
- Task failure alerts stay quiet while Fusion still owns and is retrying the recovery.
- Task detail refreshes immediately after unpausing instead of showing stale state.
- Dashboard cards revalidate on focus, tab visibility, browser back/forward resume, and SSE reconnect.
- Long task-detail titles stay stable when expanded or collapsed, and no longer flicker during window resize.
- Stale file-overlap blockers are hidden when a task is simply queued behind an unfinished dependency.
- An operator's review hold is honored before a mission task joins its shared branch.
- Stopping a task now cancels its pending workspace merge contention retries.
- Chat checkpoints no longer fail on tool output containing NUL bytes.

## 0.75.1-beta.2

### Highlights

- Dashboard secrets now bind to the selected project instead of a fallback context
- Chat-agent secret approvals work again and failed decisions show an actionable reason
- Fresh task worktrees get their secrets-env files restored
- Task detail unpause refreshes state immediately, and cards revalidate after tab or browser resume
- An operator's review hold is honored before a mission task joins its shared branch

### Security

- Dashboard secret management is bound to the selected project: secrets routes reject requests that arrive without an explicit project before any fallback context resolution.

### Fixed

- Chat-agent secret approvals no longer fail silently; prompt-gated secret reads keep the registered engine session principal, and a failed decision now surfaces an actionable reason.
- Fresh task worktrees again receive their secrets-env files, because the runtime shares the project secrets store with executor and heartbeat worktree acquisition.
- Unpausing from task detail refreshes dashboard state right away through the shared lifecycle reconciliation path.
- Dashboard cards revalidate reliably after browser and tab resume; focus, visibility, page-show, and SSE reconnect now share one fenced revalidation path.
- Long task-detail titles stay stable when expanded or collapsed, and no longer flicker during window resize.
- An operator's explicit review hold is respected before a mission task joins its shared branch; mission policy auto-merge values stay distinct from per-task operator overrides.
- Stopping a workspace merge now cancels its pending contention retries instead of letting a busy re-enqueue timer fire later.

## 0.75.1-beta.1

### Highlights

- Send a single structured review finding back for same-task revision
- Custom workflow review nodes now classify as plan or code in the Review tab
- Task failure alerts stay quiet while Fusion is already recovering the task
- Stale file-overlap blockers no longer show on tasks queued behind a dependency

### New

- Pick individual findings out of a structured workflow review and send just those back for revision on the same task, instead of rejecting the whole result.
- Custom workflow review nodes are classified as plan or code reviews, so their results accept direct feedback from the Review tab.

### Fixed

- Failure alerts are suppressed while Fusion still owns and is attempting automatic recovery of a task; you only get alerted once recovery is exhausted.
- A task queued on an unfinished dependency no longer displays file-overlap blockers left over from a lease that is no longer active.

## 0.75.1-beta.0

### Highlights

- Approving a task plan in the dashboard now resumes Plan Review automatically
- Workflow review feedback applies to the right revision again on same-task reviews
- Chat checkpoints no longer fail when tool output contains NUL bytes

### Fixed

- Approving a plan in the dashboard hands off to the engine so graph-owned Plan Review work is seeded and continues without a manual nudge.
- Review feedback selection is restored for same-task revisions: workflow review items are resolved canonically, so client-supplied feedback can no longer reach snapshots or steering unchecked.
- Chat checkpoints survive tool output containing NUL characters instead of failing to persist; checkpoint failures are now observed as best-effort rather than breaking the chat.

## 0.75.0

### Highlights

- Planning Mode approvals no longer stall — approved and rejected plans release their tasks
- Planning Mode tasks keep every interview decision and get scheduled into their workflow lane
- Todo Lists ships as an optional per-project plugin instead of a hardcoded dashboard view
- Voice Input can be enabled on supported installs, with dictation scoped to the selected project
- pnpm dev:watch rebuilds and restarts the engine after draining active agents

### New

- Todo Lists is now an optional per-project first-party plugin, with its backend route and dashboard view owned by the plugin rather than the host.
- Editable file editors gain undo and redo controls.
- List task details adapt to the available content width, routing to a split detail view when there is room; an explicit popup preference still wins.
- Mobile Planning Mode gains a shortcut to review the evolving plan after five answers, without submitting the current response.
- `pnpm dev:watch` watches development sources and restarts the engine safely: it closes new admission, drains active agents, rebuilds, and respawns.

### Fixed

- Manually approved or rejected plans now release their tasks so work can continue.
- Approved plans resume immediately once Plan Review exhausts its revision budget, recorded as an audited human bypass.
- Planning Mode tasks retain the complete set of interview decisions across single, CLI, and multi-task creation.
- Planning Mode tasks are scheduled promptly in their selected workflow lanes.
- Planning Mode can create another task from the same plan without requiring an edit first.
- Planning finalization no longer crashes after PROMPT.md writes.
- Plans reseeded by dependency changes stay recoverable instead of being silently stranded.
- Stale plan approvals are prevented, with stronger planning and review completeness checks and serialized approvals.
- Planning and review prompts converge faster: planning gathers repository evidence before drafting, Plan Review batches independent blockers, and code review traces changed invariants through consumers and tests.
- Executor credential resolution now self-heals so custom providers and renamed providers match what chat uses.
- Supported installations can enable Voice Input once its model is ready, with stable readiness reporting.
- Voice dictation create, transcription, and cleanup stay scoped to the selected project.
- Duplicate detection ignores completed and archived tasks while still protecting active work.
- Task Detail Activity thinking blocks expand by default and keep per-block collapse state while reasoning streams in.
- The floating Task Detail popup close control lines up with its header edge.
- Dependency and file-scope queue entries no longer repeat for unchanged blockers.
- Default-branch mission group merges go through the normal manual release gate via a dedicated mission integration branch.
- Plugin SDK declarations and Todo Lists CLI packaging are restored.
- Project escalation model and voice input settings strings are back in every supported secondary locale.

## 0.75.0-beta.2

### Highlights

- Dev source watching restarts the engine cleanly, draining active agents before rebuilding
- Queue activity no longer repeats dependency and file-scope blocker entries for unchanged blockers
- Duplicate detection ignores completed and archived tasks while protecting active work

### New

- Development source watching restarts the engine automatically on source changes: new admission is closed, active agents drain, the build is refreshed, and the supervised engine is respawned.

### Fixed

- Dependency and file-scope queue activity entries no longer repeat while the blocker is unchanged, so the task queue log stays readable.
- Duplicate detection now matches against active tasks only, skipping completed and archived ones across intake, planning, and recovery.

## 0.75.0-beta.1

### Highlights

- Approved plans resume immediately when Plan Review exhausts its revision budget
- Dependency-reseeded plans stay recoverable instead of stranding in the board
- Mission group merges to the default branch now go through the manual release gate
- Voice dictation stays scoped to the selected project
- Task Detail Activity shows thinking blocks expanded by default

### Fixed

- Plan Review that runs out of revisions no longer parks approved work: the bypass is recorded as an audited human decision, and the scheduler plus deferred workflow continuations wake up right away.
- Dependency changes keep the durable replan signal, so a reseeded plan stays recoverable rather than silently stranding.
- Mission default merge strategies now integrate through a dedicated mission integration branch, so default-branch landings still pass the normal manual release gate.
- Stale plan approvals are blocked, with bounded lifecycle locks, planning-episode evidence, serialized approvals, and convergent planning and review ledgers.
- Voice dictation session create, transcription, and cleanup all use the selected project's identity instead of leaking across projects.
- Planning finalization no longer crashes after writing the task prompt.
- Task Detail Activity thinking blocks open by default and keep per-block collapse state while streamed reasoning arrives.
- Planning gathers repository evidence before drafting, Plan Review batches independently discoverable blockers into one pass, and code review traces changed invariants through consumers and tests.

## 0.75.0-beta.0

### Highlights

- Approved or rejected plans now release their tasks instead of stalling in Planning Mode
- Planning Mode keeps every interview answer and can create repeat tasks from one plan
- Todo Lists is now an optional per-project plugin, with CLI packaging restored
- Executor sessions resolve custom-provider credentials the same way chat does
- Undo/redo in editable file editors, plus a mobile shortcut to review an evolving plan

### New

- Todo Lists ships as an optional first-party plugin you enable per project, moving the backend route and dashboard view out of the host.
- Editable file editors gain undo and redo controls, backed by the editor's own history and kept in sync with externally loaded content.
- Mobile Planning Mode adds a shortcut to review the evolving plan after five answers; it switches to the workspace tab without submitting your in-progress response.
- List task details now adapt to the available content width, routing to a split view when there's room — an explicit popup preference still wins.

### Fixed

- Plans you manually approve or reject now release their task so it can continue, and approved plan fingerprints survive field merges.
- Tasks created from a Planning Mode interview retain the complete set of decisions, with one shared handoff format across single, CLI, and multi-task creation.
- Planning Mode tasks are scheduled promptly in the workflow lane you selected; replayed proposal claims no longer re-wake triage.
- You can create another task from the same plan without first editing it, while repeat actions stay idempotent.
- Executor credential resolution self-heals: no more synthesized "default" credential instance, unresolved instances soft-fail to the legacy unscoped provider key, and renamed custom-provider slugs match when unambiguous.
- Voice Input can be enabled on supported installations once its model is ready, with stable readiness codes reported.
- The plugin SDK's type declarations and Todo Lists packaging are restored in full releases; the bundled Todo plugin gets its store from the runtime shim.
- The floating Task Detail popup's close control lines up with the header edge; only desktop resize targets moved outboard, preserving scrollbar clearance.
- Project escalation models and voice input states are translated again in every supported secondary locale.

## 0.74.0

### Highlights

- Machine-wide concurrency cap is gone — capacity is now two per-project numbers
- Spawned child agents count against Max Concurrent Tasks, not a hidden spawn budget
- Renamed and custom board columns now work across engine, CLI, self-healing and analytics
- Plan Review runs in the planning lane before a task takes an implementation slot
- Approval and permission hardening: no self-approval, bash containment, fn serve auth by default

### Breaking

- The machine-wide concurrency cap is removed. Capacity is now two numbers per project, and Scheduling · Global and Scheduling · Project merge back into a single Scheduling section. A stored global cap is ignored.
- Spawned child agents now count against Max Concurrent Tasks instead of the hidden per-parent (5) and global (20) spawn budgets, which are deleted. Children each take a git worktree and were previously counted by neither capacity gate.

### Security

- Full approval and permission hardening pass: the dashboard derives the decider server-side and blocks self-approval and forged actors, same-verdict replays and races return 409, pending requests expire after 24h and approved grants after a configurable TTL (default 1h).
- Unclassified tools now fail closed to policy-governed command execution, an unconditional bash containment floor denies daemon-token and credential-store reads and shell calls to the approvals API at every preset, and bash approvals bind to the exact command hash.
- `fn serve` mints and reuses a daemon token by default; `--no-auth` opts out.
- Extension tools resolve the acting principal through a session identity registry: destructive tools are withheld from agent principals, secret-get approvals redeem execute-once, and plugin task stores block destructive methods unless the manifest declares the permission.
- Deny now withholds task-creating tools from agent sessions, and the deterministic duplicate-create window widens from 60s to 10 minutes.

### New

- Plan Review now runs in the planning lane before a task takes an implementation slot, with a "Plan Review" badge on the card. Code Review and Browser Verification run with the card in In review, releasing the work slot during review.
- Multiple named credential accounts per AI provider: configure several, pick one per model, and the board keeps moving on a second account when a provider hits its limit instead of pausing.
- Choose whether Anthropic lanes use your API key or your Claude subscription, with an "In use" marker in Settings → Authentication.
- Opt-in auto-update and restart, and the post-update Restart button now reports why a restart was refused instead of sitting disabled.
- New "Limit concurrent worktrees" toggle — turn it off and Max Concurrent Tasks becomes the only limit.
- Opt-in voice dictation across dashboard composers, with Parakeet v3 model download and lifecycle management in Settings.
- Chat sessions now expose the full permission-mapped task toolset for gated agents, and Direct chat conversations can be organized with reusable tags and sidebar filtering.
- Pick the workflow used for CLI/agent-created and refinement tasks; refinement cards are titled by your own feedback and carry a "Refines" chip.
- Promote on a held card now explains why it was refused and can force execution past a pending replan.
- Task cards show creation and completion dates; Quick Add gets a visible Start button on workflows with a waiting column.
- Core, workflow, Git, agent, onboarding and utility dialogs are draggable and resizable on tablets with saved geometry.
- New Midnight, Sage, Factory Dark and Factory Light dashboard themes.
- A Settings control for the agent tool-output limit, including a no-limit option, and a quiet CLI mode that hides informational stdout.
- Project admission ranks review and execution work ahead of planning when a slot opens.
- Linked GitHub and GitLab issues are closed and explained when triage splits imported work or a task is deleted, and you get a mailbox notice whenever a task is deleted by someone other than you.
- Missions can override the project task prefix for triaged task IDs, and repeated mission validator runs are bounded by content-addressed memoization.

### Fixed

- Boards with renamed or custom columns now work end to end: merges, retries, PR merges, review stalls, replan targets, duplicate archiving, dependency unblocking, mission roadmaps, analytics, CLI task list and dashboard badges all resolve lanes from each task's own workflow instead of the legacy column ids.
- Dozens of self-healing repairs — stuck merges, ghost review cards, missing worktrees, contaminated branches, orphaned executions, stale dependency blocks — now run on renamed boards instead of silently finding nothing.
- Execution starts as soon as planning finishes, and starting a task begins planning immediately, instead of waiting out the 15s engine poll.
- Planning admission no longer freezes for the duration of every merge, the cause of 5–10 minute "Queued to plan" stalls; hung scheduler, merge and continuation passes now recover loudly with a warning instead of dying silently.
- Planning admission respects the worktree cap, so a 4-worktree board no longer runs 8 planners, and planning and review sessions run in the task's own worktree instead of the shared checkout.
- Column WIP limits are actually enforced — a move into a full column is refused instead of silently allowed.
- Worktrees are no longer deleted while a planning agent is still working in them, and leaked verification checkouts are reaped so planning stops queueing behind exhausted slots.
- Duplicate tasks no longer re-plan in a loop; a duplicate verdict is parked for your keep-or-delete decision even if the planner only states it in its reply, and GitHub imports are duplicate-checked before planning rather than after.
- Cards rejected by Plan Review are re-planned instead of stranding in Planning, and replan bounces keep the task worktree instead of re-cutting the branch.
- Tasks awaiting manual plan approval are no longer planned, reviewed or started before you approve them, and plan approval actions appear alongside the approval message.
- Plans written inside a task worktree are saved back to the main project and stored in the database.
- AI helper lanes (milestone interviews, subtask breakdown, agent generation, text refine, goal drafting, reflection, Planning Mode) run on your configured model instead of silently falling back to a default Anthropic model and returning a 401.
- Planning Mode and Settings no longer drop typed text after the first character, and expanded Mailbox reply rows stay open.
- Terminals, planning sessions and popped-out task windows survive view and tab switches; the dashboard survives mobile tab discards, resyncs on reconnect and stops caching API responses offline.
- Test mode tasks complete again — the mock executor was marking 1-based steps against a 0-based step model.
- Approval reuse and wedge resolution work on PostgreSQL projects instead of failing or minting duplicate requests.
- Waiting badges name their wait: "Queued to plan", "Ready" and "Revising" now match what the engine will actually do, and lane counts and card glow never exceed the number of running agents.
- Restore an archived card to the lane it was archived from, and archived-task document rules work on renamed archive lanes.
- Restarting during an AI merge no longer auto-pauses the task, and a paused engine reads "Paused" in the footer instead of "Idle".
- Tasks no longer park blocked on open GitHub PRs touching their files — blockers are board tasks only.
- Auto-archiving of tasks and auto-filing of recovery cards is removed; failures now stay on the task that failed.
- Compound Engineering code review parks after two unsuccessful remediation attempts instead of retrying forever, and reviews stalled by an engine restart recover in one self-healing cycle instead of ~36 minutes.
- Task API endpoints return 404 for an unknown task id instead of a 500, and task deletions record who asked.
- Mobile board swipes page immediately instead of coasting, edge swipes advance one column, and the bottom nav bar returns on large phones.
- Duplicate-warning "Open" buttons work, GitLab and Linear imports land on real board lanes, and switching projects fully resets Planning, Chat, Missions, import and open modals.
- Terminals no longer open blank until a keypress, and Windows direct-chat agent selection switches reliably.

### Performance

- Board scrolling is faster: desktop no longer snaps, phone swipes page immediately, and collapsing Archived or changing Done sort no longer re-renders every column and card.
- Agent tool output is bounded to a 16,000-character budget so large reads preserve context capacity, and verification results are trimmed to high-signal diagnostics.

### Internal

- Workflow-owned lifecycle: the legacy board and list rendering path, the pre-graph cutover machinery, and lossy column coercion helpers are deleted; review-gate leases record the node that holds them so a restarted engine can tell its own dead leases from a peer's.
- The unused cross-project concurrency table is dropped from the central database.

## 0.74.0-beta.9

### Highlights

- Midnight deep-navy dashboard theme lands with both light and dark modes
- Task Detail keeps Plan content current while planning and Plan Review run
- Done-task squash branches stop spamming reclaim logs and get deleted after completion
- Main full-suite is green again after schema, Missions hooks, and re-spec event fixes

### New

- Dashboard: Midnight, a deep-navy theme available in both light and dark modes, persisted across the dashboard and validated on Electron first paint.

### Fixed

- Task detail: the Definition/Plan prompt now refreshes while planning and Plan Review are running, so you are not reading a stale plan.
- Engine: stale-active-branch reclaim no longer floods the log for done-task squash leftovers, and those completion branches are deleted once the task finishes.
- Engine: Missions lifecycle hooks fire correctly, task updates only emit real lane moves instead of phantom dependency re-spec events, and schema/ledger bookkeeping tracks the current migrations and worktree capacity readers.

## 0.74.0-beta.8

### Highlights

- Tasks no longer park blocked on open GitHub PRs touching their files
- Board blockers are now other board tasks only, and legacy PR-blocked cards recover on their own
- Requeued task deleted at the same moment no longer strands without re-dispatch
- Planner retries fallback or unchanged output before handing off to Plan Review
- Terminal close control stays put after New terminal at every screen size

### Fixed

- Tasks are no longer parked as blocked because an open GitHub PR touches the same files. Blocking references are board tasks only, and rows previously parked by a file claim recover through the normal paths.
- Fixed a rare stall where a task requeued and deleted in the same moment never re-dispatched.
- Planning finalization now retries when the planner falls back or returns unchanged output, instead of sending that attempt straight to Plan Review.
- The terminal close control stays in place after New terminal at every screen size.

## 0.74.0-beta.7

### Highlights

- Multiple credential accounts per provider, selectable from every model picker
- Board keeps running on a second account when a provider hits its rate limit
- Review and execution work outranks planning when a project slot opens
- Reverted tasks leave Done and get Delete or Revise recovery actions
- Board lane counts and card glow match the number of actually running agents

### New

- Manage multiple credential accounts per provider from Authentication settings.
- When a provider hits its limit, work rotates to another configured account for that provider instead of pausing the board.
- Pick which configured credential account a model uses; the selector appears only for providers with more than one account.
- AI sessions start on the credential account you selected, and executor steps can switch to a rotated account without interrupting active work.
- Project admission ranks review first, then execution, then planning, with age and task ID breaking ties within a lane.
- When triage splits imported work into subtasks, the linked GitHub or GitLab issue is closed with an explanation of the split.
- Linked GitLab issues close when their Fusion task is deleted.
- Repeated mission validator runs are bounded by content-addressed memoization of validated inputs, with a durable per-project validation budget.
- PostgreSQL projects get durable, transactional task-deletion lifecycle events delivered to cross-process consumers with per-consumer cursors, receipts, leases, retries, and bounded retention.

### Fixed

- Reverted tasks no longer sit in Done; they move out with Delete or Revise actions, and Revise opens a draft prefilled with the original description.
- Lane counts and card glow no longer exceed the number of agents actually running; idle replans now read "Queued to revise".
- Manual merges waiting in renamed workflow review lanes now notify operators, and scheduler and planning reactions keep working on renamed lanes.
- Repeat task-wedge alerts stop flooding inboxes; each reason gets a six-hour cooldown that survives resolve/re-wedge flaps.
- Mission validators no longer reject passing feature assertion results, and valid validator JSON is recovered from ordinary response formatting noise.
- Mission assertion status edits and deletes no longer fail with invalid assertion IDs, and delete failures are surfaced.
- Milestone validation badges stay current after assertion repairs or removals.
- Reused execution worktrees refresh against merged dependency changes while keeping rebased task commits.
- Expanding a chat, Activity entry, or agent log now shows the complete tool-call details.
- Named Authentication actions stay targeted to the selected account, and auth status stays available when credential-instance data is missing.
- Registered projects show immediately while dashboard health metrics load.
- Task links opened from mail land in the active dashboard view.
- Upward Quick Add model and priority menus stay anchored to their trigger.
- Mobile: Summary token and cost tables scroll again, and Git Manager and GitHub Import sheets no longer leave dead space at the right edge on phones and short viewports.
- Translated dashboard catalogs cover the new reverted-task resolution actions.

## 0.74.0-beta.6

### Highlights

- Boards with renamed or custom columns now work end to end — merges, retries, self-healing, analytics
- Breaking: machine-wide concurrency cap removed — capacity is now two numbers per project
- Breaking: spawned child agents count against Max Concurrent Tasks and the worktree cap
- Approval and permission gates enforce: no self-approval, bash containment, fn serve authed
- Plan Review runs before a task takes a slot, and 5–10 min "Queued to plan" stalls are fixed

### Breaking

- The machine-wide concurrency cap is gone. Capacity is now two per-project numbers; Scheduling · Global and Scheduling · Project merge into a single Scheduling section, and the global sliders in the footer and Command Center are removed. A stored global limit is ignored, and the cross-project concurrency table is dropped from the central database.
- Spawned child agents now count against Max Concurrent Tasks and the worktree cap instead of a hidden spawn budget (previously 5 per parent / 20 global). Children each get their own worktree, so a fan-out could previously push a project past its limit while the scheduler believed it was at capacity.

### Security

- Full approval and permission hardening pass: the approvals decision route derives the decider server-side and blocks self-approval and forged actors, same-verdict replays and races return a conflict, pending requests expire after 24h and approved grants after a configurable TTL (default 1h).
- Unclassified tools now fail closed to policy-governed command execution, an unconditional bash containment floor denies daemon-token and credential-store reads and shell calls to the approvals API at every preset, and bash approvals bind to the exact command hash.
- `fn serve` mints or reuses the daemon token by default; opt out with `--no-auth`. Destructive task tools are withheld from agent principals, secret-read approvals are execute-once, and plugin task stores must declare destructive task permissions in their manifest.

### New

- Plan Review now runs in the planning lane before a task takes an implementation slot, with a "Plan Review" card badge; a card crosses into the work lane exactly once.
- New "Limit concurrent worktrees" project setting. Turn it off and Max Concurrent Tasks becomes the only limit — tasks still run in their own git worktree.
- Pick the workflow used for CLI- and agent-created tasks and for refinements; refinement cards are now titled from your feedback and carry a "Refines" provenance chip.
- Multiple named credential instances per AI provider, with the selection persisted across model configuration (inert this release).
- Chat sessions expose the full permission-gated task toolset (archive, delete, retry, pause, merge and more).
- Agent Detail, Import Tasks, Task Detail, New Task, Create Room, right-dock pop-outs and floating terminals are now movable and resizable, including on tablets, with saved geometry.
- Two new dashboard themes: Factory Dark and Factory Light, plus Sage.
- Missions can override the project task prefix for their task IDs.
- Read-only APIs that enumerate dashboard views and settings sections.

### Fixed

- Renamed and custom board columns are honored across the product: merges and merge re-enqueue, PR merges and "changes requested" reviews, retries, escalation and loop protection, replan targets, review-stall surfacing, dependency unblocking, archive and restore, duplicate flags, mission roadmaps, planner oversight, the scheduler, and roughly forty self-healing recoveries that previously matched nothing and left cards stuck.
- New tasks no longer sit queued for minutes: a hung triage poll now recovers loudly past 120s, planning admission no longer freezes for the duration of every merge, and the scheduler, merge queue and continuation drain each force-open a stuck pass with a warning.
- Planning admission respects the worktree cap, so a 4-worktree board no longer starts 8 planners; a planned card's retained worktree transfers on release instead of blocking it.
- Worktrees are no longer deleted while a planning agent is still working in them, and leaked verification checkouts are reaped so planning stops queueing behind exhausted slots.
- Stop AI Engine now actually halts the workflow graph — new Plan Review sessions no longer start while paused.
- Column WIP limits are enforced again: a move into a full column is refused instead of silently allowed. Only actively running tasks count against worktree capacity, and queued tasks can resume in their retained worktrees when capacity is full.
- Terminals, planning sessions and popped-out task windows no longer reset when you switch views or tabs.
- Restoring an archived card returns it to the lane it was archived from instead of Done.
- A restart during an AI merge no longer auto-pauses the task; merge-confirmed work finalizes instead of being parked failed.
- Test-mode tasks complete again — the mock executor was marking the wrong step numbers.
- Tasks awaiting manual plan approval are no longer planned, reviewed or started before you approve, and approval actions now sit next to the approval message. A task queued for plan review no longer waits behind cards parked on approval.
- The board Actions menu no longer appears on bare Planning cards, and the Plan action no longer shows on cards already executing.
- Imports land on real lanes: GitHub-issue imports are checked for near-duplicates before planning, and GitLab and Linear imports no longer write to a deleted column. Routines, scheduled tasks, refinements and duplicates land in the workflow's own intake column.
- Move menus offer exactly the moves a workflow allows; task moves validate against the board's own workflow. Workflow edits, deletes and switches reconcile the cards sitting in the affected columns.
- CLI fixes: `fn task list` no longer omits cards in custom columns, `fn task retry` and `fn project` work on renamed boards, and `fn dashboard` reports a real active count. Node, mesh and project commands no longer mark the host offline on exit.
- Wedge notifications can be resolved again on PostgreSQL projects, and two lock re-entrancy hangs (self-blocking dependencies, interrupted column transitions) are fixed.
- Compound Engineering code review parks after two unsuccessful remediation attempts instead of retrying forever, and graph-native workflows no longer deadlock at review with 0/N steps.
- Grok usage no longer reports a false 100% or a bogus expired login.
- Custom plan sections survive a description refresh from Fusion.
- Upstream pull requests can be created from task branches pushed to a contributor fork.
- UI polish: task-card size badges align with neighboring badges, cost badges hide when unavailable, Task Detail stays centered while scrolling, excess space below progress controls is gone, Command Center concurrency controls are aligned with the Max worktrees slider restored, and the Planning "Add comment to selection" button is no longer below the fold.
- Even Realities glasses plugin: column filters, completion notifications, review actions and the deck cap all respect renamed lanes.

### Performance

- Collapsing Archived or changing Done sort no longer re-renders every board column and card.

### Internal

- Auto-archiving of meta tasks and auto-filed recovery cards is removed; failures now stay visible on the task that failed. The classifier matched ordinary feature work and could archive live tasks.
- The unreachable legacy board and list rendering path, the retired workflow-columns flag reads, and a lossy column-coercion helper are deleted, with ratchets preventing their return.

## 0.74.0-beta.5

### Highlights

- Planning Mode and Settings keep every character you type, not just the first
- Cards no longer stall on "Queued to plan" with free slots after a planner hangs
- "Queued to plan" and "Ready" badges match what the engine will actually do with the card
- Expanded Mailbox reply-context rows stay open when you expand another row

### Fixed

- Planning Mode and Settings no longer drop typed text after the first character — the modal shell was remounting the focused input on every render.
- Cards stuck on "Queued to plan" while concurrency slots sat free are now re-offered for planning after a hung planner is evicted, instead of waiting for an engine restart.
- The "Queued to plan" and "Ready" badges on Todo cards now reflect whether the card is genuinely awaiting planning, rather than guessing from its step count. Todo rows carry this state through live board updates.
- Expanded reply-context rows in the Mailbox modal stay expanded when another row is opened; the recursive reply thread no longer remounts and collapses.

## 0.74.0-beta.4

### Highlights

- Code Review and Browser Verification now run with the card in In review, badged there
- Opt-in auto-update installs the new build and restarts Fusion on your release channel
- Cards no longer strand in Planning after Plan Review sends them back for changes
- Dashboard survives mobile tab discards, resyncs on reconnect, and stops caching API responses offline
- Agent tool output is capped at 16,000 characters, with a Settings control and a no-limit option

### New

- Code Review and Browser Verification run with the card sitting in In review, and the running step shows as a card badge. A changes-requested verdict still sends the card back to implementation.
- New global setting for auto-update and restart (off by default, in Settings → General next to Release channel). The post-update Restart button now always issues the request and shows the server's reason when it is refused, instead of sitting disabled.
- Core, workflow, and Git dialogs — 13 modal surfaces in all — are draggable and resizable on tablets, with geometry remembered between sessions.
- A Settings control for the agent tool-output limit, including 0 for no limit.
- The mobile project drop-down lists favorite projects in their own section at the top.
- You get a mailbox notice whenever a task is deleted by an agent tool or an unattributed API caller; deletions from the dashboard, CLI, and engine stay silent.

### Fixed

- Cards sent back for re-planning by Plan Review now actually get re-planned instead of sitting in Planning, and replan bounces keep the task worktree instead of tearing it down and re-cutting the branch.
- Cards can no longer sit waiting unowned on the planning path, a new watchdog reports any card idle past 30 minutes with no live session, and cards left with a stale "planning" status recover on a sweep instead of waiting for an engine restart.
- Self-healing no longer pauses cards whose planning session is still running, and queued planning admission walks past a declining lane instead of stalling the whole pass.
- Reviews stalled by an engine restart recover in one self-healing cycle rather than roughly 36 minutes, and the post-review fix budget default goes from 3 to 10.
- Review gates are harder to lose: symbol locks are reclaimed on the way back into work, hung gates are stall-detected, a just-started gate is no longer failed by a sweep, and a merge can no longer be enqueued before Code Review has run.
- Duplicate tasks are parked for your keep-or-delete decision instead of re-planning in a loop — including when the planner only reports the duplicate in its reply rather than writing the marker file.
- Deny now withholds task-creating tools from agent sessions, and the duplicate-create window widens from 60 seconds to 10 minutes so a retried create no longer duplicates.
- Approval reuse works on PostgreSQL instead of minting a duplicate request on every retry.
- A review task whose worktree was removed gets a fresh one instead of failing on every retry.
- Verification results stay concise, so a large failure dump no longer exhausts agent context.
- Incomplete foreach workflow steps are blocked from entering merge review.
- Planned hold-column cards whose Plan Review continuation was lost are recovered.
- Mobile board swipes from the first or last column advance one column instead of two.
- Task modals lose their excess tablet padding and dead right-edge space on landscape tablets while keeping usable touch resize grips; floating windows are touch-movable and resizable on tablets.
- Task-card cost badges return for legacy tasks with recorded token usage, and the size badge lines up when a card shows two status badges.
- Manual GitHub and GitLab import translations survive reopening the import panel.
- Cross-project plugin discovery no longer unloads enabled plugin skills.
- Task API endpoints return 404 for an unknown task id instead of a 500.
- Task logs no longer report engine-initiated aborts as operator hard-cancel pauses.
- Mailbox message links use theme colors instead of default browser blue.
- Routine diagnostic noise is reduced in the operator log view.
- Legacy desktop builds stay on one packageable Pi runtime dependency closure (Pi 0.82.0).
- A false handoff-invariant violation is no longer logged every time a task enters a review gate.

### Performance

- Every engine-injected tool result is bounded by a 16,000-character budget, so large reads preserve context capacity.

### Internal

- Task deletions record who asked — operator UI, CLI, agent tool, engine, or unattributed API. Attribution only; no delete gating was added.
- Review-gate leases record the node holding them, so a restarted engine can reclaim its own dead leases immediately instead of waiting out the staleness window.

## 0.74.0-beta.3

### Highlights

- Plans written in a task worktree now save back to the project and database
- Promote on a held card says why it was refused and can force past a pending replan
- Small mobile board swipes no longer jump several columns at once
- Mobile Settings footer buttons scroll sideways by touch when they overflow
- Cards no longer stay stuck with stale worktree metadata after an aborted plan

### New

- Promote on a held card now explains why the promotion was refused instead of showing a raw translation key, and offers a confirmed force option that pushes the card into execution past a pending replan. Force waives only the unplanned-for-execution gate — capacity, hold membership, and slot reservation still decide. Available from the board, the promote API, and the promote tool.

### Fixed

- Plans a planner writes inside a task worktree are now reconciled back to the main project before triage finalizes, and the authoritative plan is also stored as a task document, so plans no longer silently vanish.
- Cards are no longer left with stale worktree metadata when their branch inherited another task's commit. A branch cut from the base that never committed anything — planning aborted, card moved back to todo — was repeatedly rejected as foreign contamination on every self-healing sweep.
- Small horizontal swipes on the mobile board now advance one column instead of flinging several; extra pages require real gesture travel, not just release speed.
- The mobile Settings footer rail scrolls sideways by touch again when its buttons overflow the screen, including on landscape phones.

## 0.74.0-beta.2

### Highlights

- Two tasks can run Plan Review at the same time instead of one failing and parking
- Planning and every review step run in the task's own worktree, never the shared checkout
- Moving a card out of Todo mid-plan stops planning, clears the badge, and frees the worktree
- Session contention now waits and requeues on a 10-attempt ladder instead of parking the task
- Mobile Settings footer no longer clips the update notice and buttons

### Fixed

- Concurrent tasks no longer collide in Plan Review: the second task used to surface a provider failure and burn its retry budget. Sessions are now scoped per task even outside workspace mode.
- Planning and all review steps acquire the task's own worktree instead of degrading to the shared repo root; Plan Review re-acquires a worktree if its recorded one is gone.
- Remaining contention is treated as transient: the engine waits on a 10-attempt ladder from 5s to 60s and ends in a benign requeue rather than parking the task.
- Moving a card backward out of Todo while it is planning now aborts the in-flight planning run, clears the planning badge, and releases the pre-execution worktree.
- A new self-healing sweep reclaims parked pre-execution worktrees only after 30 days of complete inactivity, skipping todo, executing, paused, blocked, and recovery-scheduled tasks.
- On mobile, the Settings update-check result renders on its own row above the action buttons instead of being cut off; desktop and tablet keep it inline next to the version button.

## 0.74.0-beta.1

### Highlights

- Voice dictation in dashboard composers, opt-in with a checksum-pinned Parakeet v3 model
- Execution starts the moment planning finishes instead of waiting out the 15s engine poll
- Quick-add Start no longer strands tasks in Todo that could never be planned
- Open on duplicate-task warnings now actually opens the task
- Restart all agents in the System panel works again instead of erroring

### New

- Voice dictation across dashboard composers, gated behind a project-scoped Voice Input setting and disabled by default; the mic button stays inert until you turn it on.
- Voice Input settings panel for enabling dictation and managing the Parakeet v3 model, with live download and status controls.
- Parakeet v3 model downloads are verified against a pinned upstream SHA-256 checksum before use, and cached in a shared location across projects.
- Voice transcription API with project-bound audio endpoints and a lazily loaded speech runtime, so nothing extra is initialized unless dictation is on.
- Quiet CLI mode that suppresses informational stdout chatter, via the new quiet flag or the FUSION_QUIET environment variable.

### Fixed

- Starting a task now kicks off planning immediately from every surface (board drag, context menu, CLI, tools, API move) instead of waiting up to 15 seconds for the next planning poll. Todo cards still waiting on a planning slot show a "Queued to plan" badge, and the Start toast now honestly says "Queued for planning" rather than claiming planning began.
- Once planning finishes, the scheduler wakes and dispatches right away; plan-in-place workflows such as Coding (Ideas) previously sat idle until the next engine poll.
- Quick-add Start on a manual-intake workflow no longer creates tasks with placeholder steps that planning would skip forever, leaving them stuck in Todo with no log line.
- Coding (Ideas) boards can move cards back from Todo to Ideas again; the move check now respects the workflow's own column adjacency.
- The Open button on possible-duplicate task warnings works from every surface it appears on, and unresolvable task ids now show a toast instead of silently doing nothing.
- Restart all agents in the System panel no longer fails with a storage removal error.
- Planning Mode shows a single "Add comment to selection" button, and only after the selection is finished, so it no longer flickers mid-drag or duplicates on mobile.
- Creating a chat tag from the context menu applies it to the open conversation immediately.
- Reports Health Check now surfaces unrecoverable direct-report failures instead of hiding them behind stale state.
- Task composers no longer fire duplicate project-settings requests when the dictation button is present.

### Internal

- Hold-release sweeps log how long each card was held, a per-sweep summary with prefetch cost broken out, and a warning when a sweep exceeds 2 seconds.

## 0.74.0-beta.0

### Highlights
- Choose Anthropic API key vs. subscription per lane, with a clear "in use" indicator
- Fixed: AI helper lanes (subtasks, milestones, goals, reflections) no longer silently fall back to the wrong Anthropic model
- Fixed: Planning Mode no longer fails mid-interview with an auth error on a model you never picked
- Board scrolling is snappier — no more snap-lock on desktop, instant paging on phone swipes
- Tag and filter Direct chat conversations in the sidebar

### New
- Choose whether Anthropic lanes use your API key or your Claude subscription, with an "in use" marker in Settings → Authentication
- Board scrolling feels faster: desktop no longer snaps mid-drag, and phone swipes page immediately instead of coasting
- Task cards now show creation and completion dates directly
- Organize Direct chat conversations with reusable, project-scoped tags and sidebar filtering
- Quick Add now shows a visible Start button for workflows with a waiting column, instead of a hidden long-press menu

### Fixed
- Windows: direct-chat Agent selection now switches visibly and reliably
- New Task dialogs close without a discard confirmation when nothing was actually touched
- Tablets: Task Detail and New Task regain touch resizing
- AI helper lanes (interviews, subtask breakdown, agent generation, text refine, goal drafting, reflections) now run on your configured model instead of silently falling back to a default Anthropic model and erroring out for custom-provider or subscription users
- Large phones no longer lose the mobile bottom nav bar after being misclassified as tablets
- The footer now reads "Paused" instead of "Idle" when the engine is paused, and pausing from the terminal now takes two presses to avoid accidental toggles
- Planning Mode no longer fails mid-interview with a provider auth error tied to a model you never selected
- Switching projects now fully resets Planning, Chat, Missions, subtask breakdown, GitHub import, and any open modals so nothing leaks across projects
- Tablets: the Quick Chat header is easier to grab and drag
- Terminal windows no longer open blank until a keypress, font-size change, or new tab

### Internal
- Updated bundled Pi runtime dependencies to the matched 0.82.0 pair

## 0.73.0

### Highlights

- Remove the Planning Mode deepening checkpoint and fixed interview depth caps.
- Scrub top-level report activityTrace before filing so paths and tokens never reach the pipeline.
- Quality hub now shows task verification videos when review artifacts are enabled.
- Add beta and stable release channels — pick your update track in Settings or with `fn update --channel <stable|beta>`.
- Agent chat now investigates the live codebase with tools before answering architecture and code questions.

### New

- Quality hub now shows task verification videos when review artifacts are enabled.
- Add beta and stable release channels — pick your update track in Settings or with `fn update --channel <stable|beta>`.
- Agent chat now investigates the live codebase with tools before answering architecture and code questions.
- Let operators set the embedded PostgreSQL connection cap in Advanced Settings.
- Add an optional Task chat progress feed for task steps, failures, reviews, and rollbacks.
- Add mailbox approval for ephemeral agent follow-up tasks.
- Add a mission auto-merge override so a mission's features share one branch and one PR.
- Mission auto-merge controls now explain merge behavior and show shared branch PR status.
