  `hold` was absent from this map entirely, so a column whose ONLY pre-implementation trait is
  `hold` — a renamed board's wait-for-capacity lane — resolved to OTHER and vanished from the
  funnel. Measured before the fix: `stageForTraits(["hold"]) === "other"`.

  Adding it does NOT change where the merged default Planning column lands. That column carries
  `["intake","hold","reset-on-entry"]`, and `stageForTraits` prefers the earliest stage in flow
  order, so `intake` (stage 0) still wins and it resolves to `triage` exactly as before. This is
  strictly the hold-only case.

  The merged column landing in `triage` while the `todo` stage stays empty is a SEPARATE and larger
  question — it makes the funnel show a phantom 100% drop between Triage and Todo on every default
  board since U11 — and it is deliberately not settled here. Changing which stage the Planning column
  reports would retroactively alter how historical analytics read, which is not a reversible call the

FNXC:SdlcFunnelColumns 2026-07-30-09:40:
THE FALLBACK WAS THE LEGACY MONOLITHIC IR, and the only production callers use the fallback.
`aggregateActivityAnalytics` (Command Center's `/command-center/activity`, and the OTel exporter) never
passes `columns`, so every project's funnel was mapped through `BUILTIN_CODING_WORKFLOW_IR` — the
constant the catalog now publishes as `builtin:legacy-coding`, not the current default. The same
legacy-constant-vs-catalog split produced the "preflight is stale" drift in the move resolvers.

Consequence: any column id absent from that legacy set folds to OTHER, so a renamed or custom board's
Command Center funnel reads as empty while the board is plainly busy. The doc comment says callers with
a custom workflow "should call `aggregateSdlcFunnel` directly"; no caller does, which is what makes this
the default path rather than an edge case.

`resolveDefaultWorkflowIr()` is the shared authority every other default resolution uses, so the
built-in fallback now agrees with the board Fusion actually ships.

SCOPE, corrected after I overstated it: post-U11 the current lineage's column ids are a SUBSET of the
legacy constant's, so this change alone fixes NO renamed board — it only stops the fallback describing a
board Fusion no longer ships (a consistency fix, and it is why `defaultColumns` cannot have a
behaviour-revealing test on its own). The renamed/custom case is fixed by the CALLER passing `columns`,
which is why `aggregateActivityAnalytics` now accepts them and the Command Center route resolves the
project's own workflow. I nearly shipped the consistency change as if it were the whole fix; the
give-away was a revert proof that would not go red.

 * empty project simply yields zero counts and the unavailable-MTTR sentinel.
 * Breakdowns bucket NULL/blank source/severity/status as `unknown`, matching
 * the sync `COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'unknown')` shape.
