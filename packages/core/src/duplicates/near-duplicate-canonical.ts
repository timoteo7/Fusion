FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-04:00 (batch-core feed):
"Still active" is the negation of core's terminal ROLE, not of two column names.

`columnFlags` is the column's resolved trait flags; omitted, `isTerminalColumnRole` falls back to the
legacy ids, so an unconverted caller is byte-identical and this file carries no fallback of its own.

The failure direction here is the expensive one. This predicate exists (see the note below) so a
FINISHED canonical stops holding a near-duplicate flag open. Keyed on the literals, a finished
canonical on a renamed board still read as ACTIVE, so the flag never cleared and the flagged task
stayed parked behind a user decision that could never arrive — the exact stranding the FNXC note
above says this function was written to prevent.

DELIBERATE-LITERAL: the `column === "archived"` below is intentional — historical pre-reintegration
rows in the sentinel column are inactive evidence, not a workflow terminal role, so they must be
excluded by the literal sentinel id.
