/**
 * Async data-layer foundation (U4) — replaces the synchronous DatabaseSync adapter.
 *
 * FNXC:AsyncDataLayer 2026-06-24-09:00:
 * The synchronous `DatabaseSync` surface (`db.prepare(sql).get/run/all`,
 * `db.transaction(fn)`, `db.transactionImmediate(fn)`) is replaced by an async
 * Drizzle-backed connection. This module defines the stable data-layer
 * interface (the "AsyncDataLayer") that plugin stores and the decomposed
 * task-store modules consume, and provides the core CRUD/transaction
 * primitives they depend on.
 *
 * Why this module exists:
 *   R6 — the sync DatabaseSync data-access surface is replaced with an async
 *   data layer; no blocking/synchronous bridge to PostgreSQL remains
 *   (VAL-DATA-001). Every PostgreSQL client is async, so every data call site
 *   must be awaited. Store methods are already `async`, so the boundary exists;
 *   this module is the inner layer they call into.
 *
 * What this module provides (the foundation; U12-U15 migrate the actual stores):
 *   1. `AsyncDataLayer` — the stable interface plugin stores consume. It exposes
 *      the runtime Drizzle instance, a `transaction()` primitive, and
 *      `transactionImmediate()` for write-heavy paths.
 *   2. `transactionImmediate(async (tx) => ...)` — the async equivalent of the
 *      SQLite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` path. In SQLite this acquired the RESERVED lock
 *      before user code ran so writers fail/retry before the callback executes.
 *      PostgreSQL uses MVCC (no BEGIN IMMEDIATE), so the closest equivalent for
 *      write-heavy paths is a transaction with READ WRITE access mode. All
 *      writes inside the callback commit atomically; a thrown error rolls back
 *      every write including audit rows (VAL-DATA-002, VAL-DATA-003).
 *   3. `recordRunAuditEventWithinTransaction(tx, input)` — the run-audit-event
 *      insertion that runs *inside* a shared transaction so the audit row
 *      commits or rolls back atomically with the mutation it accompanies
 *      (the run-audit-event-within-transaction behavior).
 *   4. The `getDatabase()` accessor contract changes to return this async-capable
 *      connection rather than the synchronous `Database` (U15 converts the
 *      direct-`prepare()` consumers that relied on the sync shape).
 *
 * Transaction isolation (VAL-DATA-004):
 *   Concurrent transactions do not observe each other's uncommitted writes.
 *   PostgreSQL's default `READ COMMITTED` isolation already guarantees this —
 *   a transaction never sees another transaction's uncommitted rows.
 *   `transactionImmediate()` defaults to `READ COMMITTED` (matching the SQLite
 *   behavioral contract: SQLite's default is also a read-committed-equivalent
 *   under WAL). Callers needing stricter guarantees can pass an isolation level.
 *
 * Concurrency model change:
 *   SQLite used WAL multi-process-over-one-file with BEGIN IMMEDIATE for
 *   write serialization. PostgreSQL uses a server process with MVCC, which
 *   structurally removes single-writer contention. The atomicity contract
 *   (multi-statement mutations commit/rollback together) is preserved by the
 *   Drizzle transaction callback wrapper.

 * program against this interface, not the underlying driver (VAL-DATA-016).
 *
 * Members:
 *   - `db` — the runtime Drizzle instance for queries outside explicit
 *     transactions. Schema-typed for compile-time safety.
 *   - `transaction(fn, options?)` — run `fn` inside a PostgreSQL transaction.
 *     All writes inside `fn` commit atomically on success; a thrown error
 *     rolls back every write (VAL-DATA-002, VAL-DATA-003). The callback
 *     receives a transaction handle with the same query surface as `db`.
 *   - `transactionImmediate(fn, options?)` — the write-heavy-path variant,
 *     equivalent to SQLite's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. Defaults to READ WRITE access
 *     mode. Use for multi-statement mutations and the
 *     run-audit-event-within-transaction pattern.
 *   - `ping()` — connectivity probe.
 *   - `close()` — release the connection pool.
 *
 * Stability contract:
 *   - Adding methods is backwards-compatible.
 *   - The signature of `transaction` / `transactionImmediate` is stable; do
 *     not change the callback shape or the return type without a major-version
 *     plugin contract bump.
 *   - The `db` member may gain schema (new tables) but its query-builder
 *     surface is stable.
