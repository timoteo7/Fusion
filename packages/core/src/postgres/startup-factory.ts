/**
 * Runtime startup factory: construct a PostgreSQL-backed TaskStore.
 *
 * FNXC:RuntimeStartupWiring 2026-06-26-14:00:
 * This is the single startup entry point that production construction sites
 * (engine InProcessRuntime, dashboard project-store-resolver, CLI serve/
 * dashboard commands, desktop local-server/local-runtime) use to boot
 * PostgreSQL.
 *
 * The factory encapsulates the five-step backend boot sequence so individual
 * call sites do not each re-implement backend resolution, connection opening,
 * schema application, AsyncDataLayer construction, and dual-read harness
 * integration. The factory always returns a ready {@link BackendBootResult}
 * or throws an actionable startup error.
 *
 * Resolution rules (matching the mission architecture):
 *   - DATABASE_URL set (external mode): connect to the external PostgreSQL
 *     server, apply the schema baseline, construct the AsyncDataLayer. Returns
 *     a backend boot result.
 *   - DATABASE_URL unset (embedded mode): start the bundled embedded
 *     PostgreSQL, then proceed like external mode against the embedded URL.
 *     This is the DEFAULT production path — embedded PG is the zero-config
 *     backend, mirroring the zero-config SQLite experience it replaces.
 *   - DATABASE_URL unset AND FUSION_NO_EMBEDDED_PG=1: reject the obsolete
 *     configuration. SQLite files are accepted only as migration inputs.
 *
 * FNXC:BackendFlip 2026-06-26-14:05:
 * The default backend was flipped from SQLite to embedded PostgreSQL in this
 * change (feature flip-embedded-pg-default, cutover milestone). Previously
 * embedded PG required an explicit opt-in via FUSION_EMBEDDED_PG=1; now it is
 * the default. FUSION_EMBEDDED_PG=1 is still honored as a no-op alias for backward
 * compatibility (it cannot force embedded when DATABASE_URL is set, since
 * external mode always wins). The flip is safe because the embedded-postgres
 * platform binaries are now bundled for macOS/Linux/Windows (arm64/x64) and
 * the boot smoke has been updated to exercise the embedded path by default
 * with an initdb-aware health-check timeout.

Issue #2286 auto-recovery. An embedded cluster initdb'd by an earlier version
on a non-UTF-8 OS locale (WIN1252/WIN1254) rejects the UTF-8 schema SQL with
`character ... has no equivalent in encoding`. Such a cluster can NEVER have
completed a boot: the whole baseline runs in one transaction whose query
string fails encoding conversion before execution, so no schema was applied
and the SQLite auto-migration (which runs after schema boot) never moved any
data. Deleting the data dir and re-initdb'ing (now forced UTF-8) is therefore
lossless — but only when proven, so recovery requires ALL of:
  1. embedded mode (Fusion owns the data dir),
  2. the encoding-conversion error signature,
  3. the live cluster confirming a non-UTF-8 server_encoding,
  4. zero tables in project/central/archive and no recorded migration
     versions (the never-successfully-booted state),
  5. this process owns the postmaster (never delete under a foreign owner).
One retry only; a second failure surfaces the manual re-init hint.
