/**
 * PostgreSQL schema applier.
 *
 * FNXC:PostgresSchema 2026-06-24-03:40:
 * Applies the fresh Drizzle migration baseline to a PostgreSQL connection
 * and records it in a migration bookkeeping table. The baseline migration
 * (migrations/0000_initial.sql) is the snapshot of the final SQLite schema
 * (SCHEMA_VERSION=128) translated to PostgreSQL — applying it to an empty
 * database yields final-schema parity (VAL-SCHEMA-001).
 *
 * After the baseline lands, plugin-owned tables are materialized via the
 * schema-init hook (VAL-SCHEMA-007). The applier calls each registered plugin
 * hook so plugins evolve their own tables independently of the core migration.
 *
 * Migration tracking uses a single-row bookkeeping table in the public schema
 * so the applier is idempotent: re-running against an already-migrated database
 * is a no-op. The version-gate discipline (the institutional learning that
 * fresh-DB tests cannot catch a skipped-on-upgrade migration) is carried
 * forward via the applier's explicit baseline marker.

Per-migration identities above stay fixed; only this latest-version marker moves.

FNXC:WorkflowTaskContinuations 2026-07-21:
SCHEMA_BASELINE_VERSION advances to 0031 for durable, single-owner task
continuations at workflow column boundaries.

FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-21-17:30:
SCHEMA_BASELINE_VERSION advances to 0037 for dropping the cross-project concurrency table; it previously advanced to 0036 for normalized Direct conversation tags; it previously advanced to 0032 for fusion_runtime SELECT +
SECURITY DEFINER write access to the legacy-adoption drained marker.

Advance the ceiling to 0065 for FN-149's review-convergence columns. FN-149 registered
REVIEW_CONVERGENCE_STAGE_VERSION and wired the migration but left this marker at 0064, which is a
SELF-REJECTION rather than a compatibility guard: the first open applies 0065 and records it in
fusion_schema_migrations, then the NEXT open (the project store, in the same boot) hits
assertBinaryNotOlderThanDatabase, sees 0065 > 0064, and throws StaleBinarySchemaError. Every
startup died with "this binary only knows up to 0064" on fresh and upgraded databases alike. This
marker is ONLY the binary's "highest migration I know" claim — bumping it applies no SQL and
touches no data; it must advance in the same change that ships a new migration file.

FNXC:StaleBinaryGuard 2026-07-19-03:10 (U9b / R10):
Old-binary write refusal. Migration bookkeeping is forward-only, so a database carrying a
version ABOVE this binary's SCHEMA_BASELINE_VERSION was migrated by a newer Fusion. Letting
the old binary proceed writes rows using the previous schema's assumptions (the observed
stale-Homebrew-binary failure mode). Compared numerically, not lexically; unparseable
identifiers are ignored so a plugin marker cannot brick every open.

FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-19-14:30 (PR #2341 review):
The ignore-unparseable rule is a load-bearing coupling, not just plugin defense:
LEGACY_ADOPTION_DRAINED_MARKER (below) is a deliberately NON-NUMERIC bookkeeping row that
`adoptLegacyTaskRowsOnOpen` (task-store/lifecycle-ops.ts) writes into
fusion_schema_migrations after a fully-drained adoption sweep. This guard MUST keep
skipping non-numeric versions, or the marker would present as a "newer database" and
brick every open.

FNXC:StandaloneExeMigrations 2026-07-17-13:30:
The bun-compiled standalone `fn` binary runs its bundled code from the virtual
/$bunfs/root filesystem, so the historical `join(__dirname, "migrations")`
resolution points at a path that does not exist on disk (bun --compile does not
embed readFile assets) and every DATABASE_URL boot died with
ENOENT /$bunfs/root/migrations/0000_initial.sql. Resolution order:
  1. FUSION_MIGRATIONS_DIR env override — always wins when set (operator escape hatch).
  2. join(__dirname, "migrations") — the npm/tsup and desktop layout; kept first
     among the probes so nothing changes for existing installs.
  3. join(dirname(process.execPath), "migrations") — the standalone-exe layout,
     where build.ts / the release tarball stage migrations/ next to the binary.
The existsSync probe (not a runtime-detection heuristic) picks between (2) and
(3): inside the compiled binary the module-relative dir simply does not exist,
while for node-based installs it always does, so npm/desktop behavior is untouched.

    because `select()` emits the binary's full column list. Every chat query 500s, the task planner
    chat never opens, and startup reports success — the applier had nothing left to do.
