/**
 * PostgreSQL schema applier.
 *
 * FNXC:PostgresSchema 2026-06-24-03:40:
 * Applies the fresh Drizzle migration baseline to a PostgreSQL connection
 * and records it in a migration bookkeeping table. The baseline migration
 * (migrations/0000_initial.sql) is the snapshot of the final SQLite schema
 * (SCHEMA_VERSION=128) translated to PostgreSQL — applying it to an empty
 * database yields final-schema parity (VAL-SCHEMA-001).
 *
 * After the baseline lands, plugin-owned tables are materialized via the
 * schema-init hook (VAL-SCHEMA-007). The applier calls each registered plugin
 * hook so plugins evolve their own tables independently of the core migration.
 *
 * Migration tracking uses a single-row bookkeeping table in the public schema
 * so the applier is idempotent: re-running against an already-migrated database
 * is a no-op. The version-gate discipline (the institutional learning that
 * fresh-DB tests cannot catch a skipped-on-upgrade migration) is carried
 * forward via the applier's explicit baseline marker.

the old binary proceed writes rows using the previous schema's assumptions (the observed

`adoptLegacyTaskRowsOnOpen` (task-store/lifecycle-ops.ts) writes into
