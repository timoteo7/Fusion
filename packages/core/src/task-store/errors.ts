/*
FNXC:Authorization 2026-08-09-03:04:
Authorization had no typed error anywhere in @fusion/core. A denial was an HTTP status at the edge and a REGEX OVER ERROR STRINGS in the engine (see isOperatorActionableAgentError in packages/engine/src/errors/transient-error-detector.ts), so nothing downstream could tell a permission denial apart from any other failure.
Two concrete consequences this class exists to fix. First, `handleGraphFailure` in packages/engine/src/executor.ts replaces a node failure's message with a generic "Workflow graph terminated with failure at node '<n>'" string, which erased the reason an operator needs. Second, the dashboard could not distinguish "you may not do this" (403) from "your session expired" (401), so a denial fired the token-recovery flow and told the user to re-authenticate for a permission they simply do not hold.
The `code` discriminant is what makes both fixable without string matching. Shape mirrors AgentTaskRoutingPolicyError (packages/core/src/agents/agent-role-policy.ts), the existing typed-policy-error precedent in this codebase.
*/
/*
FNXC:Authorization 2026-08-09-03:04:
The discriminant is exported as a constant because it must survive SERIALIZATION, not just a
type check. A node handler's thrown error is flattened to `error.message` by the workflow graph
executor before the executor's terminal park ever sees it (packages/engine/src/workflows/workflow-graph-executor.ts,
`node:<id>:error` context patch), so the receiving side compares a plain string against this
constant rather than calling `isPermissionDeniedError` on a live Error instance.

 * must be able to distinguish "this task is gone" from "the server is broken".
 *

 * leftover from the file-backed storage era. In Postgres/backend mode nothing on
