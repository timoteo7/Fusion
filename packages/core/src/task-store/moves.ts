FNXC:WorkflowReviewGates 2026-07-26-16:40:
Single authority for "is this move a RECOGNISED entry into `in-review`?", consumed by both the
backend-transaction and SQLite-transaction emit sites of `task:handoff-invariant-violation`.

Requirement history: the invariant dates from when `TaskStore.handoffToReview(...)` was the ONLY
legal way into `in-review`, so any other arrival was genuinely suspicious and worth auditing. After
the U1 IR-driven lifecycle cutover the workflow GRAPH owns column transitions — node column
assignment is the authority and the graph column boundary (`workflow-column-boundary.ts`
`onNodeEntry`) performs the move via `store.moveTask`. Moving the pre-merge review gates
(`code-review`, `browser-verification`) into the `in-review` column then made the graph cross that
boundary on EVERY gate entry, so a legitimate, fully-provenanced transition emitted a violation
audit on each crossing (observed on FN-8596 15:19:22: a violation immediately followed by the
`browser-verification` `task:column-transition`).

The fix is narrow ON PURPOSE: the invariant is NOT retired, because it still catches the movers it
was written for — operator drags, merge bounces, self-healing rehomes, and any future call site
that lands a card in review without going through handoff. Only a move carrying the graph's own
provenance is recognised. `workflowMoveSource: "workflow-graph"` is produced at four call sites,
ALL inside the executor's own graph / column-boundary machinery (the boundary hook plus the
graph-owned merge-boundary moves). No non-graph mover writes that literal — operator drags carry
`moveSource:"user"` and recovery sweeps use their own provenance (e.g.
`"self-healing-advanced-triage"`) — so neither can spoof it.

Parameterized by a count callback so each path supplies its own in-transaction

inside a synchronous `db.transactionImmediate` callback and MUST count, judge,

transaction), while the backend path awaits the returned promise. Counting
stays sequential in the async case, matching the original per-column awaits
against the same transaction handle. A shared `limitSetting` pools multiple
wip columns, so occupants are summed across every column sharing the target's

        column's targets from the task's own workflow adjacency instead, still throwing the same
        legacy-style bare Error (not TransitionRejectionError) so the flag-OFF characterization contract
        holds for legacy columns. Ported from main's FN-7591 fix into the extracted moves.ts.

        FNXC:CodingIdeasWorkflow 2026-07-25-10:05:
        A LEGACY source column must also honor the task's own workflow adjacency, not only
        VALID_TRANSITIONS. Symptom: in Coding (Ideas) an operator could move Ideas → Todo but the
        reverse drag/menu action ("Move to Ideas") failed with "Invalid transition: 'todo' → 'ideas'.
        Valid targets: in-progress, triage, archived" — `todo` IS a legacy column, so the legacy branch
        ran and VALID_TRANSITIONS (a closed six-id map that cannot know about "ideas") had the final
        say. Both the Board drag pre-check and the context menu already offered the move, so the
        rejection surfaced only after the optimistic move snapped back.
        Fix: UNION the legacy targets with the workflow-resolved adjacency for legacy sources. This
        only ever RELAXES (never narrows) the legacy set, so builtin:coding stays byte-identical — its
        resolved adjacency reproduces VALID_TRANSITIONS verbatim — while any workflow that inserts its
        own column beside a legacy one (Ideas ↔ Todo here) becomes freely movable in both directions.
        The workflow IR is resolved lazily, only when VALID_TRANSITIONS alone would reject, so the
        happy-path move cost is unchanged.

    Column side effects run through the default-workflow TRAIT HOOKS unconditionally. The
    `if (useWorkflow)` gate and its inline legacy `else` branch are DELETED, not converted —
    converting a branch we intended to delete would have left a second definition of every
    column side effect alive to drift.

    WHY THIS WAS SAFE TO FLIP, evidenced rather than asserted:
      - `moves-flag-equivalence.test.ts` runs the SAME journey under both flag states against live
        PostgreSQL and diffs the persisted row: identical across 128 fields plus an equal timing
        shape, over todo -> in-progress -> in-review -> todo -> in-progress. Mutation-verified in
        both directions (stamping this branch, and diverging the reopen hook, each fail it).
      - The flag was read by NOTHING in production: `experimentalFeatures.workflowColumns` is
        global-only and no module writes it, so this branch had never run for any project that did
        not carry a stale persisted value. That is also why "the suite is green" was never evidence
        on its own — both paths were individually valid and only one was live.
      - Target-column validation was NOT introduced by this flip. I claimed it was, twice, and
        reproduced the opposite: a move to a column the task's workflow does not declare already
        rejects on the legacy path with `Invalid transition: ... Valid targets: ...`. See the seam-2
        cases in that same test file.

      "runs INSIDE moveTaskInternal's transaction and is NEVER bypassable"; that was

      is absent from DEFAULT_GLOBAL_SETTINGS and has no production writer, so the whole

      documents and the UI exposes was silently not enforced.

      SCOPE, deliberately narrow: only the CAPACITY check is un-gated. `workflowIr`
      stays flag-gated so transition VALIDATION keeps its current behavior — the
      inline path's bare-Error/"Valid targets:" contract is unchanged, and none of the
      Phase A2 divergences are flipped here. `capacityIr` is resolved separately for

      ONE selection snapshot, read on `tx`, feeding BOTH derived values.

      The defect this replaces: the pool id came from `capacityPoolIdForMove`
      (resolved pre-transaction, near the top of the move) while the IR came from a
      SECOND, independent `getTaskWorkflowSelectionAsync` inside
      `resolveTaskWorkflowIrForMove`. A workflow-selection change landing between
      those two reads made the gate resolve its LIMIT from workflow B's IR while
      counting occupancy in workflow A's POOL — an empty pool measured against a
      populated column's limit, so the move is admitted into a full pool.

      That is the SAME SHAPE as the R1 sentinel this PR's sibling fixed: gate and
      counter disagreeing about which pool, so a finite limit cannot bind. It is
      not acceptable to argue the window is small — this PR is the moment capacity
      starts actually binding, so a gate that leaks under concurrent selection
      change is a defect introduced exactly where operators begin depending on it.

      Deliberately NOT reusing `workflowIr` here even when the compatibility flag is
      on: that value is resolved pre-transaction from its own separate read, so
      reusing it would preserve the very split this fixes on the flag-on path.
      `workflowIr` remains the input to transition VALIDATION, which is a different

      Take the per-task advisory lock BEFORE reading the selection.

      A consistent snapshot alone fixed only the INTRA-process split. The read was
      still unlocked: `transactionImmediate` runs at READ COMMITTED, where a plain
      SELECT takes no row lock, so another TaskStore on another node sharing the
      same central database could change this task's workflow selection right after
      the read. The move would then enforce the OLD workflow's pool and limit while
      committing the task under the NEW one — the gate leaking at exactly the moment
      operators start trusting it.

      `withTaskLock`, which the selection writer holds, does NOT help here: it is an
      in-process promise chain, so it serializes one store instance and nothing
      across nodes. Multi-node is several nodes against one PostgreSQL database, so
      this is a supported deployment shape, not a hypothetical.

      With the lock held for the rest of this transaction, the selection cannot
      change until the move commits or rolls back — so the pool id and limit
      enforced below are the ones the commit lands under. The matching acquire is in

    ever left WIP at handoff/terminal. It stopped being harmless when the pre-merge review gates
    moved into `in-review`: the gate crossing releases the task's declared symbols, then the paired
    remediation node re-enters `in-progress` and edits the SAME files in the SAME live worktree with
    its fine-grained locks gone. The only two acquire sites (the scheduler's todo->in-progress
    dispatch and `claimDueWorkflowWorkItem`) are not on the graph's re-entry path, so nothing
    reclaimed them.

    Deliberately BEST-EFFORT: on conflict we log and proceed unlocked rather than rejecting the
    move. Rejecting would park the remediation behind a symbol another task now holds — turning a
    lock-granularity problem into the stranding failure this whole change set exists to avoid — and
    would need a new `TransitionRejectionCode`. Proceeding unlocked is exactly the pre-fix posture,
    so the contended case is no worse than today while the common (symbol free) case is repaired.
    Coarse protection still applies via `shouldHoldActiveFileScopeLease`, which keeps a live
    in-review task's file-scope lease held against scheduler todo-dispatch overlap.
