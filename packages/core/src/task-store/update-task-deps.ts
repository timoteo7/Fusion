    compared ONLY the resolved lanes, and `refine-duplicate-task.pg.test.ts` immediately failed with
    "task is in 'done', must be in 'published' or 'editorial-review'" — a row sitting in `done` on a board

    operator action on it is a worse outcome than accepting one extra column name.

    OVER-INCLUSION IS THE SAFE DIRECTION HERE: this gate answers "may the operator refine this?", so being
    too permissive occasionally allows a refine from a column that is not really terminal, while being too
    strict makes `fn_task_refine` unavailable for a legitimately finished task with no recourse. Same

    Provenance is NOT lost — it moves to affordances that do not consume the title: the
    `task_refine` source chip on the card, the parent link in the detail view, and the
    `Refines: <id>` line kept in the description plus the real `dependencies` edge.
    `deriveFallbackTaskTitle` is the same deterministic, never-LLM derivation other titleless

      I flagged this question in three files rather than guessing at it — executor.ts, the task routes, and

      disagree about which cards are blocked. It is settled here, in the store, which is where the blocker

                     with no way to clear them short of editing the graph.

                     excluded `in-review`, which is the same rule stated as an exclusion.)

      Each dependency resolves through its OWN workflow — dependencies can live on different boards — with
      one shared IR cache for the set. On a renamed board this comparison matched nothing, so EVERY
      dependency read as unresolved and `blockedBy` was set to the first one forever: the dependents never

      Review in a distinct review column, sends it back to INTAKE for re-specification. Both ends
      were literals, so this never fired on a renamed board — and converting
      only the guard would have written an `intake` column the board may not declare directly into the row,
      which is worse than not firing: the store would hold a card in a column that does not exist.

      A board declaring no intake column keeps the card where it is; the dependency is still recorded and
      still blocks, so nothing is lost except a re-specification hop that board has no lane for.
