 * maintenance sweep (`prune-agent-log-files`) called it unguarded, so every PG
 * sweep with retention enabled threw and agent-log pruning never ran. This
 * async variant is the PostgreSQL equivalent: it reads the inactive task ids
 * (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL OR column = 'archived'`, where `archived` is the
 * historical persistence sentinel) from project-scoped `project.tasks` and delegates
 * file pruning to the shared helper. Query
 * semantics mirror the SQLite path exactly.
