/**
 * Async Drizzle merge-queue / merge-coordination helpers (U13).
 *
 * FNXC:TaskStoreMergeCoordination 2026-06-24-05:00:
 * Async equivalents of the sync SQLite merge-queue call sites in store.ts
 * (`enqueueMergeQueue`, `acquireMergeQueueLease`, `releaseMergeQueueLease`,
 * `recoverExpiredMergeQueueLeases`, `peekMergeQueue`, `cleanupStaleMergeQueueRows`).
 * These helpers target the PostgreSQL `project.merge_queue` table via Drizzle and
 * preserve the two load-bearing merge-coordination invariants:
 *
 *   VAL-DATA-013 — Handoff-to-review mergeQueue transactional invariant. The
 *     column move (`UPDATE tasks SET column = 'in-review'`), the `merge_queue`
 *     insert, and the handoff audit fan-out run in ONE transaction; observers
 *     never see `column = 'in-review'` without the matching queue row. The
 *     `enqueueMergeQueueInTransaction(tx, ...)` helper is the building block
 *     the handoff path composes inside its `transactionImmediate(async (tx) => ...)`.
 *
 *   VAL-DATA-014 — Merge-queue lease semantics. Leases are acquired in the shared
 *     FN-509 queue order: an effective Boost first, then task arrival
 *     (`tasks.created_at`) oldest-first. Expired leases recover WITHOUT
 *     incrementing `attempt_count` (the attempt counter only advances on an
 *     explicit failure release, not on a silent lease expiry).
 *
 * FNXC:TaskQueueOrder 2026-09-17-12:07 — ordering note:
 *   FN-509 deleted the priority rank. The merge queue now orders by exactly the
 *   same expression every other queue reader uses (`taskQueueOrderBy`), so a card
 *   cannot lease out ahead of older work merely because its merge was requested
 *   manually. A manual request keeps its result promise and permissions; it just
 *   joins the common order.
 *
 * Transition context (see library/taskstore-persistence-notes.md):
 *   `getDatabase()` still returns the sync `Database` until U15 flips it. The
 *   TaskStore facade keeps its sync merge-queue path (the gate depends on it).
 *   These helpers are the async target the migrating store and the PostgreSQL
 *   integration tests consume. They program against the stable `AsyncDataLayer`
 *   interface (U4), not the underlying driver.

`reviewColumns` is the caller's RESOLVED review set. It has to come in rather than be resolved here:
this runs inside an open transaction with only a `tx` handle — there is no store to resolve from, and
adding a workflow read inside the merge-queue transaction would extend its lock window for a question
the caller has already answered.

SYMMETRY IS THE POINT. Enqueue admits a card from its review lane; `dequeueMergeQueueOnColumnExitInTransaction`
removes it when the card leaves. If only one of the two resolved, a renamed board would either enqueue
cards nothing ever dequeues (a queue that fills and never drains) or dequeue against a queue nothing
ever filled. Both take the same set, from the same caller, in the same transaction.

    THE HEAD SELECT CANNOT NAME THE LANES, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT YET KNOW THE TASK.
    Each queued row can run a DIFFERENT workflow, so "is this row in review?" has a
    different answer per row and the resolver is keyed by task id. The select is
    therefore a CANDIDATE SUPERSET — ordered exactly as before — and each candidate
    is resolved in turn until one qualifies. The chosen row's own resolved lanes then
    go into the UPDATE's WHERE, so the atomic re-check is preserved: the row is only
    leased if it is STILL both available and in one of ITS review lanes.

    Without a resolver (callers that cannot resolve workflows) the predicate stays
    the literal and the loop stops at the first candidate — the previous behaviour.

    The candidate scan is bounded. The stale sweep above has already deleted rows
    whose task left review, so under normal operation the first candidate qualifies;
    the bound only caps the pathological case where the sweep could not resolve.

 *     task leaves the queue for good) and a `mergeQueue:lease-released` audit
 *     event with `outcome: "success"` is recorded.
 *   - **failure**: the merge failed. The queue row is retained, the lease is
 *     cleared (`leased_by`/`leased_at`/`lease_expires_at` set to NULL), and
 *     `attempt_count` is incremented by 1. A `mergeQueue:lease-released` audit
 *     event with `outcome: "failure"` is recorded. The row returns to the

 *
 * Ownership check: only the current lease holder may release. A release from a
 * different worker is rejected with `MergeQueueLeaseOwnershipError`.
 *
 * NOTE on the attempt counter (VAL-DATA-014): `attempt_count` advances ONLY on
 * an explicit failure release. It does NOT advance on a silent lease expiry
 * (see `recoverExpiredMergeQueueLeases`). This distinguishes a genuine merge
 * failure from a worker that crashed mid-lease.
