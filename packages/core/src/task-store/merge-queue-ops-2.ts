FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-10:00 (u12 — DELETED, not converted):
`enqueueMergeQueueSyncInternalImpl` and its `store.enqueueMergeQueueSyncInternal` entry point are gone.
Merge-queue enqueue is PostgreSQL-only via `enqueueMergeQueueAsync` (task-artifacts-ops.ts); the sync
SQLite arm had ZERO callers — every remaining mention was a comment. Its `column !== "in-review"` guard
was carried in the census as deferred debt "needing a store-architecture change to convert". It needed
no conversion: the code it guarded was unreachable on the shipped backend. Removing dead code is why the
count drops here, so do not read this file's 0 as a converted seam.

    FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-08-02-10:20 (fleet: the PR-merged transition):
    ONE SNAPSHOT for the whole transition — the pre-check, the RE-READ check, and the MOVE TARGET. This
    function reads the row twice on purpose (a merge can land between the checks), and each read was
    compared against the default lineage's ids while the move went to the literal `done`.

    On a renamed board every one of those answered wrong in the same direction: `column === "done"` never
    matched, so an already-complete card was not skipped as `already-done`; `column !== "in-review"` always
    matched, so the transition bailed with `wrong-column` for a card sitting in review. The net effect is
    that a PR merged on GitHub never advanced the card — the visible symptom is a merged PR whose Fusion
    task stays in review forever, which reads as a webhook problem rather than a column problem.

    The move target comes from the same snapshot: converting the guards alone would admit the card and then
    move it to a column the board does not declare, which is the half-conversion this program keeps paying
    for. A board with no complete column refuses the transition instead of inventing one.

    FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-08-02-14:10 (PR #2733 review — greptile P1, and my COMMENT contradicted
    my CODE):
    A WORKFLOW THAT DECLARES COLUMNS BUT NO COMPLETE LANE REFUSES, it does not fall back to `done`. My first
    version wrote `?? "done"` while the comment above it claimed the transition refuses rather than inventing
    a column — the reviewer read the code, not the prose, and was right. `moveTask` would have rejected the
    undeclared `done` and left the merged card in review, which is the exact failure this conversion exists to
    prevent, reintroduced by a two-character default.

    The distinction is `PlannerLanes`' contract, and it is the one the whole program keeps re-learning:
      - NO LANE INFORMATION AT ALL (v1 IR, unresolvable store) -> the legacy ids ARE the answer; nothing has
        told us otherwise and today's behaviour is correct.
      - LANES RESOLVED, complete ABSENT -> the board genuinely has no completion column. Substituting one
        invents a destination; refusing is the honest outcome and is visible in the return value.

    THE RACE IS REAL AND `moveTask` IS THE BACKSTOP. If the task's workflow selection changes between the
    resolution above and this call, `completeColumn` describes the old board while `moveTask` validates against
    the new one — and it REJECTS an unknown column rather than writing it. So the failure mode is a thrown
    move and `moved: false`, not a card in a column that does not exist.

    Narrowing the window further (resolve inside the move, or take a workflow lock) is a store-level change:
    every converted move in this program has the same shape, and moveTask's validation is what makes them all
    safe. Named here rather than left implicit, because "resolved then moved" reads racy and the reason it is
    acceptable lives in a different file.
