/*
FNXC:PostCommentRetriage 2026-07-29-19:30 (U11 lifecycle-column conversion):
STATUS is the discriminator here, not the column id.

Callers reach this only after establishing the card sits in a pre-implementation
column, so re-testing the column inside was always redundant — and after U11 it was
WRONG. `builtin:coding` resolves to BUILTIN_STEPWISE_FINAL_REVIEW_CODING_WORKFLOW_IR,
whose merged Planning column keeps the id `todo` and declares no `triage` column at
all. The old `column === "triage" && status === "awaiting-approval"` therefore never
matched a default card, and the consequences were graded:

  - with a real spec, the card fell through to the re-triage arm — same
    `needs-replan` write, but audited as "requested re-specification" instead of
    "invalidated spec approval";
  - with a bootstrap-stub spec, `hasRealPrompt` was false and NEITHER arm fired, so
    an operator comment on a card awaiting spec approval invalidated nothing. The
    approval silently stood.

Dropping the column re-checks fixes both and removes 2 of this file's 3 `triage`
literals. The remaining one is the caller's gate (`column === "todo" || column ===
"triage"`), which is deliberately left: it covers BOTH vocabularies, so it still
fires for default cards, and narrowing it to traits needs an IR the caller does not
have.

    This gate previously listed the two LEGACY ids (`todo`, `triage`). That covers both legacy
    vocabularies but NOT a renamed one: `builtin:coding-ideas` places its intake in `ideas`, matching
    neither, so an operator comment on an Ideas card awaiting spec approval invalidated nothing — the

    non-default workflow through here.

    Resolved from the card's own workflow rather than listing ids. The earlier note here said
    narrowing this "needs an IR the caller does not have" — the caller has `store` and `id`, which is
    all `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` needs.

    Two deliberate choices:
      - The IR is only resolved for a USER comment, so agent/system comment traffic pays nothing.
      - An unresolvable workflow falls back to the legacy pair. This is a best-effort re-triage whose
        failure mode is a MISSED re-spec, so keeping the old behaviour beats dropping the card out of
        the branch. Note `resolveLifecycleColumns` throws on a missing IR, so the null-check is
        load-bearing, not defensive decoration.

Shared by both document paths so the "is this card archived?" answer cannot differ between the write
guard and the publication guard — one saying yes while the other says no is how a card ends up both
read-only and un-publishable.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-04:10:
The helper that used to live here now lives in `project-lane-vocabulary.ts` and is imported. It grew a
THIRD caller (`getLiveTaskColumn`, whose sentinel a dozen sites compare against), and three private
copies of one fact is how the disagreement above happens at scale rather than between two functions.
The analysis below is unchanged and still governs the shape.
/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-03:35 (#2886 review — greptile P1, "project-wide lanes
misclassify tasks"): THE FINDING IS RIGHT AND THE OBVIOUS FIX IS A WORSE TRADE. Measured, not argued.

The union includes a column if ANY enabled workflow calls it archived, so where two workflows reuse an
id and only one marks it archived, a LIVE card in the other workflow's lane is refused its own
document writes. That is the flat-set mistake this file should not be making, and both callers have
`taskId`, so a keyed answer looks available.

I IMPLEMENTED IT AND REVERTED. Switching to `resolveWorkflowIrForTask(store, taskId)` broke
`archived-document-lanes.pg.test.ts`: a card in a RENAMED archived lane stopped being read-only. The
reason is the one this program keeps hitting from the other side — the per-task resolver needs the
task's own workflow SELECTION, and where none is recorded it degrades to the BUILT-IN ir, whose
archived lane is `archived`. The project union does not need a selection, which is exactly why it
caught the renamed card.

So the two failure modes are not comparable in size:
  - union: a live card in a COLLIDING id loses document writes (needs two workflows reusing one id
    with different traits — a configuration nobody has reported).
  - per-task: EVERY renamed-lane card with no recorded selection silently becomes writable while
    archived, which is the defect this guard exists to prevent and has a passing test.

The correct fix is per-task resolution WITH a project-union fallback when the selection is absent —
narrow when the card can answer, broad when it cannot. That needs the "no selection" case
distinguished from "selection resolved to the default", i.e. the provenance form, at both call sites.
Sized here rather than faked, because swapping one defect for a larger one would have looked like
progress and dropped a guard count.
