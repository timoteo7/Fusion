      `reviewColumns` and silently kept the legacy single-lane fallback — while
      `getInReviewStalledSignal` three lines down received the resolved SET. On a board declaring a

      invisible on every builtin board because there the set has exactly one element.

      Measured before fixing: of the four `getInReviewStallReason` call sites in this file

    Two constraints shape this. The map is sync, so an await cannot go inside it
    without converting a hot board-list path to Promise.all — a restructure this
    fix does not need. And `getStalePausedTodoSignal` is a no-op for a card that
    is not paused, so resolving for every row would buy nothing at real cost:
    paused cards are a small minority of a board, and the shared `irCache` means
    those few resolve one IR per workflow. A board with no paused cards does zero

    share one IR cache, so a page spanning three workflows reads three IRs regardless of
