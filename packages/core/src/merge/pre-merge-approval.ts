FN-295: `archiveTerminalWorkflowStepFailures` archives EVERY terminal failure on the card, not only the
gate whose remediation is running. A Plan Review row that a restart had left `pending` — rewritten to
`failed` by the FN-8492 orphaned-step sweep, never by a reviewer — was therefore archived as collateral
of a Code Review remediation. The archived carrier is then a permanent merge veto (`remediationArchivedAt`
is unconditional below) that NO recovery owns: the reseed handles only `missing`, the stale-content
reroute only `stale-content`, and the FN-7720 operator bypass selects only `status:"failed"`. Measured on
FN-295: three review restarts each re-ran Code Review and Documentation successfully and still merged
nothing, because the poisoned row is in neither of those lanes.

This resolver restores such a collateral carrier to the terminal failure it actually was, so the card is
recoverable again through the ordinary audited bypass. It deliberately does NOT approve anything: no
verdict is written, and a row carrying a real operator waiver (`bypassedBy`) or belonging to the gate that
owns the remediation wave is never touched.
