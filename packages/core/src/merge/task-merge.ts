FN-408's execution-entry fence is `isTaskBlockedOnHumanPlanApproval`, which lives in
`planner/human-plan-approval.ts` and is deliberately NOT imported here. Two reasons:

1. Semantics: `isTaskBlockedOnApproval` above also guards PLANNING continuation dispatch
   (in-process-runtime). Folding the per-card human requirement into it would stop the planner and
   the reviewer from ever producing the plan the operator is supposed to validate, so the card could
   never become decidable. The two predicates must stay separate.
2. Bundling: this module's exports are consumed by the dashboard's browser bundle, while
   `planner/human-plan-approval.ts` transitively imports `planner/plan-approval.ts` and its
   top-level `node:crypto`. Importing it here pulls `node:crypto` into the browser graph and breaks
   the dashboard build — measured on 2026-09-15. The browser mirror in
   `packages/dashboard/app/utils/reviewBudgetApproval.ts` exists for exactly this reason.

`reviewColumns` threads straight through to `getTaskMergeBlocker`, for the same reason that helper takes
it: omitted, the identity check falls back to the literal `in-review` and refuses a card sitting in its
own board's review lane.

This wrapper was the blind spot behind a whole class: its callers are self-healing sweeps whose column
QUERY was also a literal, so the unwired check was unreachable and therefore unnoticed. Widening a
sweep's query ACTIVATES it — the sweep starts finding renamed-board cards and this then declines every

DELIBERATE-LITERAL — the review-eligible SENTINEL, reviewed 2026-07-30-18:20.

NOT a lifecycle column. `getTaskHardMergeBlocker` answers "is this card blocked by anything other than
where it sits?", and its callers are recovery paths for work that has ALREADY LANDED — a merge-confirmed
card whose graph crashed can be resting in any column. They pass this sentinel so the identity check is
satisfied by construction and the real blockers (paused / blocking status / incomplete steps / failed
pre-merge steps) remain the sole deciders.

Named and exported because two recovery paths were spelling it independently, and one of them
(`project-engine.ts`) forgot to and instead passed the card's own column — which on a renamed board
parked already-merged work as `failed` with "Merge confirmed but finalization blocked: task is in
'signoff', must be in 'in-review'". One name, one meaning, one place to find it.

`mergeConfirmed` means the branch HAS landed. The statuses below are in-flight bookkeeping the graph
never got to clear, so on a merge-confirmed card they are soft state to drop — not hard blockers that
park finished work `failed`.

Extracted because the two finalization paths were spelling the set independently and had already
DIVERGED: `auto-merge-finalization.ts` cleared `queued`, `project-engine.ts` cleared only the two
`merging*` values. `queued` is a BLOCKING status (`SCHEDULER_TRANSIENT_STATUSES`), so a merge-confirmed
card the scheduler had queued reached the blocker check with it intact and got parked `failed` — the
same "already-landed work parked failed" bug this change fixes for renamed columns, surviving one layer

FNXC:MergeConfirmedFinalization 2026-08-23-21:40 (FN-9193 aftermath — the wedge that outlived the race):
A CARD WHOSE BRANCH IS ALREADY ON THE TARGET MUST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO FINALIZE. FN-9193 landed
eaa1d47c on main and was then left `mergeConfirmed: true` WITH incomplete steps, because a Code
Review revision request reset its steps while the approved merge was in flight. Every finalization
site evaluated `getTaskHardMergeBlocker`, which counts incomplete steps, so the card could never
reach `done` — it sat `failed` re-reading its own contradiction for five hours, and a RESTART made it
strictly worse: replanning issued seven fresh `pending` steps, so the retry that was supposed to
rescue the card re-created the exact condition blocking it. A self-defeating loop with no exit.

Incomplete steps are not a safety property here. Holding the card out of `done` does not un-merge
anything; the code is live on the target branch either way. The only thing the hold buys is an
inconsistent board and an alarming failed card. Landing proof is established BEFORE this check by
the callers' `hasDurableMergeProof` / reachability verification, so this is not a laundering path:
`mergeConfirmed` alone never reaches here.

What still blocks: a failed or pending PRE-MERGE workflow step (a review that actually rejected this
content is a real signal even post-landing, and the operator-bypass path exists for it). What no
longer blocks: incomplete `steps`, which describe implementation work that the landed branch has
already superseded. Callers must surface the unfinished steps rather than silently dropping them.

    - FN-9193's shape: `mergeConfirmed` with the landed `commitSha` — this engine performed the
      merge and recorded it. Incomplete steps here describe work the landed branch superseded, so
      they must not hold the card.
    - The content-scan recovery (`recoverAlreadyMergedReviewTasks`): mergeDetails is ABSENT and the
      sweep infers landing by finding matching content on the base branch, then synthesizes a
      record. That heuristic can match a cherry-pick or a similar commit, so exempting steps there
      would launder a genuinely unfinished task to `done` on a guess. Its own reliability test
      (`landed-content-soft-blocker.real-git.test.ts`) pins that distinction: soft blockers clear,
      incomplete steps hold.

  A no-op merge with no commit sha also fails this test, which is what the executor's no-op branch
