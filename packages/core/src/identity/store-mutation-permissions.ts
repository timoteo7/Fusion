FNXC:IdentityStoreMutations 2026-08-09-03:04:
THE STORE-MUTATION PERMISSION MAP (U5, R15/R17).

Which catalog permission each gated `TaskStore` mutation requires. `assertAuthorized` answers "may
this actor do X"; this table is what supplies X at the store seam, so a mutation cannot be guarded
with whatever permission happened to be in scope at the call site.

SCOPE, STATED PLAINLY so this is not read as more than it is: `TaskStore` exposes ~299 methods, ~184
of them mutating. This table covers the surface the plugin gate already classifies — the destructive
methods and the writes plugins may perform — NOT all 184. That is a deliberate first tranche, not an
oversight, and {@link assertEveryGatedMutationIsMapped} is what keeps it honest: a method added to
either gate list without a permission here fails CI rather than silently defaulting to allow.

Two rules for extending it:
  1. A new destructive method needs an entry in the SAME commit that adds it to the gate list. The
     census exists to make that non-optional.
  2. Map to the narrowest permission that is true. `archiveTask` is `tasks:archive`, not
     `tasks:delete` — archive is reversible via `unarchiveTask`, and collapsing them would force an
     operator to grant deletion authority to allow board hygiene.

 * Gated mutation -> required permission.
 *
 * `getDatabase` maps to `runtime:file-write-delete` rather than any `tasks:*` entry because it hands
 * out a raw handle whose blast radius is not tasks at all — it is arbitrary SQL. Mapping it to
 * `tasks:delete` would understate it and would let an actor with ordinary task-deletion authority
 * reach the whole database.
 *
 * `bypassFailedPreMergeReviewStep` maps to `runtime:review-gate-bypass`, its own entry, for the same
 * reason it is denylisted in the plugin gate: bypassing a failed review gate is a distinct authority
 * from merging, and an operator must be able to grant `tasks:merge` without granting it.
 *
 * `init`/`close` are deliberately ABSENT and excluded by the census below: they are lifecycle, not
 * data. Requiring a permission to open a store handle would gate the act of connecting rather than
 * any mutation, and would make an unauthenticated read path fail at construction.
