FNXC:IdentityPermissions 2026-08-09-03:04:
THE UNIFIED PERMISSION CATALOG (U4, R13/R17, KTD6/KTD18/KTD20/KTD21).

One model covering humans and agents, replacing `AGENT_PERMISSIONS` (an authority axis, boolean) and
`AgentPermissionPolicy` (a disposition axis, argument-derived). Neither predecessor is deleted or
repointed here: the old policy stays authoritative through Phase 4 and this module runs as read-only
shadow evaluation. Retargeting `agent-action-gate.ts` now would switch agent gating OFF for every
intermediate commit, because `can()` short-circuits while `identity.enabled` is false. U19b owns the
retarget and the deletions.

Three structural decisions the predecessors force on this model:

1. A grant is a `(permission, disposition)` PAIR, never a boolean (KTD6). `require-approval` is a
   live protocol driving real `ApprovalRequest` rows, and `block` is a denial an operator configured
   on purpose. A boolean permission set silently collapses both into "not allowed", which is a
   behavior change disguised as a refactor.

2. Resolution takes the invocation's ARGUMENTS, not just the permission name (KTD6). The existing
   categories are argument-derived: `bash` routes to `git_write` or `command_execution` by inspecting
   the command string, and `resourceType`/`resourceId` come from `args.path` and a command hash. A
   grant keyed on a static tool name cannot express "allow bash, require approval when the command is
   a git write" — which the shipped `unrestricted` preset relies on. So `can()` classifies the
   invocation first and resolves against the classification.

3. Two outcomes sit ABOVE the catalog and are not grantable entries: the coordination `exempt` floor
   (FN-3724 — see {@link EXEMPT_FLOOR_SOURCE}) and workflow authority (KTD21, engine-side). A catalog
   entry can be reconfigured to `allow`; a floor cannot be reconfigured at all.

 * `require-approval` is a PROTOCOL, not a verdict, and the whole protocol crosses into the unified
 * model — carrying only the disposition would re-open two recorded incidents.
 *
 * The key binds a grant to `(actor, task, tool, category, resourceType, resourceId, operation)`, and
 * `resourceId` carries a hash of the exact shell command. Incident one: the non-git bash key used to
 * collapse to the operation `"shell command"`, so ONE approved request authorized arbitrary future
 * shell commands for that agent+task. Incident two: chat passes an empty ambient task id, so every
 * project-scoped call by an agent collapsed into one empty-task key and approving task A let task B
 * execute — hence `effectiveTaskId` falling back to the arg-derived target.
 *
 * A reimplementation minting one approval per `(actor, permission)` reintroduces both. Field order
 * and the `|` join mirror `computeApprovalDedupeKey` in the engine gate so keys are comparable across
 * the shadow period.
