FNXC:TaskDeleteAttribution 2026-07-26-14:30:
Four tasks were deleted inside one hour in a live project and the run-audit rows could not answer
"which one did the human delete?". Two concrete holes produced that: (1) `task:deleted` metadata
persisted `auditContext.sessionId` but never `auditContext.taskId`, so an AI agent's `fn_task_delete`
call recorded only the tool surface (`agentId:"pi-extension"`) and the CALLING task/agent was lost
forever; (2) the dashboard `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` handler hardcoded `agentId:"system"`, so an
operator clicking Delete in the UI and a script hitting the same endpoint produced byte-identical
rows. This module is the single closed vocabulary that fixes both: `callerKind` names the class of
actor and `callerTaskId` names the calling task.

TRUST MODEL — read before extending. `callerKind` is ATTRIBUTION, NOT AUTHENTICATION. The HTTP
variants are derived from a self-reported `x-fusion-client` request header, so all the row can
honestly claim is "the client identified itself as the dashboard UI" (`operator-ui`) versus
"nothing identified itself" (`api-unattributed`). Anything can send the header. Never gate a
permission, a delete, or any other decision on this value, and never describe it as proof of a
human. It exists so forensics has a starting hypothesis, not a verdict.

Scope note: this is observability only. No delete-blocking, gating, or permission logic is added or
implied here; whether agents should hold `fn_task_delete` at all is a separate operator policy call.

 * - `operator-ui` — an HTTP client that identified itself as the dashboard UI (see trust model).
 * - `operator-cli` — the interactive `fn task delete` command, which prompts a human for
 *   confirmation at a terminal. Added beyond the original four because that surface is a real,
 *   distinct human actor already tagged `agentId:"cli"`; without its own member it would have to
 *   masquerade as `api-unattributed` and re-blur exactly the operator-vs-automation line this
 *   change exists to draw.
 * - `agent-tool` — an AI agent's tool call (`fn_task_delete`). Pair with `callerTaskId`.
 * - `engine` — an autonomous engine lane (triage split-close, duplicate resolution, self-healing).
 * - `api-unattributed` — an HTTP caller that sent no recognized client header. The deliberate
 *   default: unknown is recorded as unknown rather than guessed as operator.

 * could exist on the type, be passed by `fn_task_delete`, be consumed by the self-delete guard, and
 * still never reach persisted metadata without anything flagging it.
 *
 * `taskId` is the CALLER's task (the task whose agent is asking for the delete), not the target.
 * It doubles as the self-delete guard input (`auditContext.taskId === id` is refused) and, from

FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04:
Unified onto `RunMutationContext` (KTD2) so the delete path stops being a second, differently-shaped
mutation-context seam — it had `agentId`/`runId` in common with `RunMutationContext` and diverged
from there, which is how an authenticated actor could have been threaded through one path and not
the other.

R21 — `actor` (inherited, required) and `callerKind` (below, optional) are DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLAIM
and are deliberately kept as separate fields. `actor` is authenticated. `callerKind` is derived from
the self-reported `x-fusion-client` header; anything can send it. Read the module trust-model note
above before touching either: `callerKind` must never gate a permission, and no code may fall back
to it when `actor` is missing — that fallback is exactly how a self-reported header would become an
authorization input.
