/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-12:30 (lifecycle-column census enabler):

`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` returns the default coding IR in two cases that are NOT the same as
knowing which workflow governs a task: the selection read threw, and the store reported no
selection (the synchronous PostgreSQL path does exactly that). Callers cannot tell a guess from a
real answer, and for lifecycle-column work that difference decides correctness.

Concretely: post-merge the default coding lineage declares `todo` as its single Planning column
and NO `triage`. A call site converting a `column === "triage"` guard to trait resolution
therefore stops firing for `builtin:legacy-coding` cards whenever the store cannot name the
workflow — it silently gets the default's vocabulary. Every site converted so far has had to keep
the legacy ids unioned "just in case", which is why the census stalls rather than converging.

These pin the three answers a caller needs to distinguish, and that the existing function's
behaviour is untouched.

  THE FOURTH DEGRADATION PATH — a BUILT-IN id that is not registered.

  The three cases around this one all go through `store.getWorkflowDefinition`. A workflow id that
  LOOKS built-in never does: `resolveWorkflowIrById` takes the `isBuiltinWorkflowId` branch, calls
  `getBuiltinWorkflow`, and on a miss silently returns the default coding IR. That miss was the one
  path that never got the fallback brand, so provenance reported `selection` for an IR that is a
  guess — and a caller gated on that signal trusts default lanes as the board's own.

  Reachable in production: a plugin-registered workflow whose plugin is no longer loaded, or an id
  recorded by a newer build than the one reading it.

  A FALLBACK FOR ONE TASK MUST NOT MARK EVERY LATER RESOLUTION.

  `resolveDefaultWorkflowIr()` returns a SHARED object, so branding it in place marked the singleton
  itself: after any task anywhere hit a fallback, every subsequent resolution of `builtin:coding`
  reported `default` — including a task that genuinely selected the default workflow. Process-wide,
  permanent, and invisible, because the brand is non-enumerable and survives no dump or deep-equal.

  It also made the unregistered-builtin case above unfalsifiable: the object under assertion had
  already been branded by an earlier case in this file, so the mark could be deleted with the suite
  still green. Ordering matters here — the fallback runs FIRST, deliberately.
