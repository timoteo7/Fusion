FNXC:PreMergeApproval 2026-08-24-07:10:
Measured failure this guards: on builtin:coding-ideas every card reached the merge and was
refused with "task has no provable approval for the content being merged", then looped. The required
pre-merge set for a review-column workflow is
`plan-review, verification, documentation-delivery, code-review`, but only a CONTENT REVIEW records
a `reviewInputFingerprint`. The deterministic verification gate (exit codes) and the
documentation/delivery gate have no diff to bind, so they fell through to the fingerprint comparison
and were classified `unprovable-content` — an unsatisfiable merge gate.
builtin:review-gated-coding carries the identical requirement set and the identical latent defect.
