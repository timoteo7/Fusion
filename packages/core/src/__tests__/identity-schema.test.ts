/**
 * FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04:
 * U2 of the pluggable user identity plan: migration 0059 adds the actor registry, credentials,
 * sessions, and provider links to `central`, plus project-scoped role grants to `project`.
 *
 * What these tests exist to catch:
 *   - A migration registered in fewer than the four required sites in `applySchemaBaseline` never
 *     runs, and every other test still passes. Only asserting the tables EXIST on a real database
 *     detects that.
 *   - A `project` table whose PK omits `project_id` makes the steady-state ownership audit throw on
 *     every SUBSEQUENT boot — never the first. Only a second `applySchemaBaseline` catches it.
 *   - Storing a raw session value would upgrade the accepted "local shell user reaches Postgres"
 *     residual to "impersonates any administrator over HTTP" (and the same for a backup dump).
 *   - KTD11: `project_auth_*` looks dead but has a live writer (the SQLite→Postgres cutover
 *     migrator); a missing target there is a fail-closed startup error, so it must survive 0059.
