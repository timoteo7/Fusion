FNXC:LifecycleColumnRatchet 2026-07-30-09:10 (U12 R12 — AST, replacing the grep):

THE MEASURING INSTRUMENT for the lifecycle-column conversion, and the authority on the number.

WHY IT HAD TO STOP BEING A GREP. Three people measured this surface with three regexes and got
three answers (6, 8, 12 for the agent-role bucket alone). Every figure quoted at the program today
— 57, 48, 45, 34, 56, 46 — was grep-derived, and those were not measurements but estimates with a
consistent bias. A regex cannot distinguish:

  task.column === "triage"        a lifecycle guard           <- the thing being counted
  role === "triage"               the planning AGENT's role   <- correct code, must never convert
  sessionPurpose === "triage"     a session purpose           <- correct code
  surface === "triage"            a docs surface name         <- correct code
  `column === "triage"` in prose  an FNXC note quoting the OLD behaviour

Parsing removes two whole defect classes instead of patching them:
  - COMMENTS ARE NOT NODES. Every FNXC note here explains an old comparison by quoting it, so a text
    scan counts the project's own requirement history as violations. The previous revision of this
    file needed a hand-rolled block-comment tracker for exactly that, and still only caught the
    cases it thought to look for.
  - QUOTE STYLE AND LINE BREAKS VANISH. `"triage"`, `'triage'`, and a comparison wrapped across
    lines are one shape to the AST and three patterns to a grep.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. There is no type checker here, only a syntax tree, so classification is by
RECEIVER NAME. That is a real limit and it is why the lists below are explicit and auditable rather
than clever. It errs toward COUNTING: an unrecognised receiver is treated as a column, so a new
binding name inflates the number and demands attention instead of disappearing from it.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnRatchet 2026-07-30-23:00 (U12 — the fourth fail-open in this file):
AN UNNAMEABLE RECEIVER IS COUNTED, NOT DROPPED.

The AST rewrite fixed quoting and line-orientation, but `receiverName` still understood only a
ONE-LEVEL property access or a bare identifier, and the caller `continue`d on `undefined`. So these
were silently uncounted:

    task["column"] === "triage"                  // ElementAccess
    metadataColumn(entry, "to") === "in-review"   // CallExpression
    (flag ? from : to) === "triage"               // ConditionalExpression
    (task!.column) === "triage"                   // Parenthesized / NonNull wrapper
    task.column === `triage`                      // NoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral

Live, not theoretical: `metadataColumn(entry, "to") === "in-review"` in
`dashboard/src/reliability-metrics.ts` is THREE real lifecycle guards this ratchet was not counting.
Found by printing what the scanner reported as unnamed instead of trusting its total.

That is the fourth time this file has failed OPEN — grep quoting, then the `/\w*[Cc]olumn/` name
pattern, then one-level property access. Same mechanism every time: a shape the scanner did not
understand became "not a column" and left the count. So the fix is the PROPERTY, not the case: walk
through wrappers, resolve a call to its callee name, and emit a `<SyntaxKind>` SENTINEL for anything
still unnameable. A sentinel is counted AND trips the classification test, so a human judges it
instead of it vanishing. Fail closed — which is what makes this number safe to gate on at all.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnRatchet 2026-07-30-01:30 (PR #2647 review — greptile, and worse than reported):
TIGHTENED TO THE MEASURED COUNTS, because slack made this a ratchet in name only.

The review's finding was that this test is not in the blocking gate, so a regression can merge. True,
and fixed (`packages/core/package.json` -> `test:unit-gate`). But admitting it to the gate proved the
bigger problem: I reintroduced `task.column === 'triage'` and the gate STAYED GREEN at 158 passed.

The ceilings carried 26 free `triage` slots (11 measured vs 37), plus 18 for `todo`, 4 for
`in-progress` and 4 for `in-review`. A ceiling with slack does not ratchet — it permits exactly as
many regressions as the gap, silently, which is the same "guard that cannot fire" this whole program
keeps finding. Being in the gate was necessary and not sufficient.

Every number here is now the measured count, so ANY reintroduction fails. Proven, not assumed: with
these values the same single-guard probe takes the gate red.

LOWER these as conversions land; a raise means a literal came back OR detection improved — and if it
is the latter, say which sites in the commit, as previous revisions of this file did.

SITES THAT MUST NEVER BE CONVERTED, asserted as a positive.

The program has been tracking these counts toward zero. Zero is not reachable, and pursuing it means
breaking working code — the same trap as demanding conversion of `role === "triage"`, one level up.
Two categories are permanent, each for a stated reason, and both are protected here so a future sweep
cannot "finish the job" by removing them:

1. `dashboard/app/components/command-center/MissionControlPanel.tsx` — `FUNNEL_STAGES` is a deliberate
   NAME-SIMILARITY heuristic for the SDLC funnel. It matches synonyms (`signal`, `backlog`, `to-do`,
   `ready`, `shipped`) and folds anything unrecognised into an "other" bucket precisely so a custom
   board still contributes counts. It is not asking "does this column have the intake trait" — it is
   bucketing arbitrary column NAMES for display. Resolving it to traits would change what the funnel
   shows and would drop the synonym coverage that makes it work on boards Fusion has never seen.

2. `core/agents/live-agent-count.ts` — the no-flags arm. Documented in that file and in earlier revisions of
   this one: it is REACHABLE (a remote store is deliberately given an empty flag map, and a card in a
   column its workflow no longer declares has no flags at all), and deleting the literal would make
   such a card match NO arm, so the footer's queued total would silently under-report a stranded card.

This test exists because a count with an undocumented floor invites someone to drive it to zero. The
honest target is: these sites, and nothing else.
