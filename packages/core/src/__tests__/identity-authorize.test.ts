/**
 * FNXC:IdentityAuthorize 2026-08-09-03:04:
 * U5 store-seam authorizer tests.
 *
 * Every test here is a DENIAL assertion, which is the shape that passes for free when the code under
 * test never runs — `docs/solutions/best-practices/proving-a-code-path-actually-runs.md` records that
 * an earlier guard returning first makes a negative assertion vacuous. Two defenses are used
 * throughout rather than trusting the shape:
 *
 *   1. Every denial test has a POSITIVE TWIN in the same describe block: the identical setup with the
 *      one bit flipped that should permit it. If the twin does not allow, the denial proved nothing
 *      about the bit under test — it proved the fixture was broken.
 *   2. `resolveGrants` is a spy. Where a denial must happen BEFORE grant resolution (unresolved
 *      actor), the test asserts the spy was never called; that is what distinguishes "denied for the
 *      stated reason" from "denied because the fixture had no grants".
