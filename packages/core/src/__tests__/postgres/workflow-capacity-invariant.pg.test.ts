/*
FNXC:WorkflowCapacity 2026-07-27-20:10 (Phase A3 — workflow-owned lifecycle):
GROUND TRUTH for the in-transaction column-capacity invariant.

`workflow-capacity.ts` states the enforcement "runs INSIDE `moveTaskInternal`'s
transaction and is NEVER bypassable (not a guard — runs regardless of
bypassGuards/recoveryRehome/moveSource)". Phase A2 observed the opposite: with
`maxConcurrent: 1` and an occupied wip column, a second move into that column
was ACCEPTED. This suite establishes which is true, by test.

RESULT: the invariant does NOT hold for default-workflow tasks, for TWO
independent reasons, each proven separately below.

  R1. THE POOL-ID SENTINEL MISMATCH (the live defect).
      `moves.ts:319` resolves the pool for a task with no workflow selection as
          (await getTaskWorkflowSelectionAsync(id))?.workflowId ?? "builtin:coding"
      while the counter buckets rows with no selection under
          row.wid ?? DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_POOL_ID          // "__default-workflow__"
      (`countActiveInCapacitySlotAsyncImpl`). The two sentinels differ, so for a
      no-selection task the check asks for occupants of a pool that no occupant
      is ever bucketed into: the count comes back 0 and the limit can never bind.
      The SECOND enforcement point — the hold/release sweep at
      `hold-release.ts:116` — uses `?? DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_POOL_ID` and is correct,
      so the two points disagree about pool identity. That is precisely what the
      module docstring claims is impossible ("the two enforcement points can
      never disagree on what a limit *is*, only on the live count").

  R2. THE `useWorkflow` GATE (why the live path is unaffected either way).
      The whole in-txn capacity block sits inside
      `if (useWorkflow && workflowIr && fromColumn !== toColumn)` (moves.ts:921),
      and `useWorkflow` reads the raw `experimentalFeatures.workflowColumns` key
      that nothing in production sets. So on the LIVE path the check does not run
      at all — R1 is latent there and becomes reachable the moment the paths
      converge onto the flag-ON side.

The discriminating experiment is the third case: giving the tasks an EXPLICIT
`builtin:coding` selection makes both sentinels agree, and the rejection appears.
That is what distinguishes a sentinel bug from "capacity is simply not wired".

STATUS: these tests document TODAY'S behavior and fail if it changes. The two
that pin the defect are named `DEFECT:` and assert the wrong-but-current outcome
deliberately — flipping them to expect rejection is the fix's acceptance test.
Fixing is NOT done here: turning enforcement on changes scheduling for every
project (the graph column boundary parks on `capacity-exhausted`), so the blast
radius is reported for an operator decision first.

  FNXC:WorkflowCapacity 2026-07-28-16:10 (PR #2499 review — greptile: split capacity state):
  THE SPLIT-SNAPSHOT RATCHET.

  The capacity gate derives TWO things from the task's workflow selection: the
  LIMIT (from the resolved IR) and the POOL KEY the occupancy count buckets on.
  Before this fix they came from two INDEPENDENT reads — the pool id from a
  pre-transaction `getTaskWorkflowSelectionAsync`, the IR from a second one inside
  `resolveTaskWorkflowIrForMove`. Neither was serialized with the count, which runs
  on the move's transaction handle. A selection change landing between them made
  the gate measure workflow A's (empty) pool against workflow B's finite limit and
  admit into a full column.

  That is the R1 sentinel defect in a new costume: gate and counter describing
  different pools, so a finite limit cannot bind. It matters precisely BECAUSE this
  PR is where capacity starts binding — a gate that leaks under concurrent
  selection change is a defect introduced exactly where operators begin relying on
  it.

  HOW THIS DISCRIMINATES, deterministically rather than by racing threads: the
  pre-transaction reader is stubbed to report a workflow that DIFFERS from the one
  actually persisted — which is what a concurrent selection change looks like from
  inside the move. The stubbed workflow's pool is empty; the persisted one's is
  full. Old code trusts the stub for both the pool key and the IR, so it measures
  an empty pool against a finite limit and admits. The fix reads the selection once
  through the transaction handle, so the PERSISTED value decides and the move is
  refused.

  FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS TEST WAS WORTHLESS, and the revert-proof is the only reason
  that is known: it stubbed a per-CALL sequence to hand the two old reads different
  values, but the pre-transaction telemetry read silently consumed the first entry,
  so both capacity reads landed on the same value and the reverted code passed. The
  order-independent form below does not depend on how many times the reader is
  called — which is the property a ratchet needs, since call counts are exactly the
  kind of thing a later refactor changes without noticing.

  THE LOCK RATCHET. Fails if the capacity read moves back outside the lock.

  The snapshot fix closed the INTRA-process split (one read feeding both the limit
  and the pool key). It did nothing about the CROSS-process one: the read ran at
  READ COMMITTED, where a plain SELECT takes no row lock, so another TaskStore on
  another node sharing the same central database could change this task's workflow
  selection immediately after the read. The move would enforce the OLD workflow's
  pool and limit while committing the task under the NEW one.

  `withTaskLock` — which the selection writer holds — cannot cover this: it is an
  in-process promise chain over a Map, so it serializes one store instance and
  nothing across nodes. Multi-node is several nodes against ONE PostgreSQL
  database, so this is a supported deployment shape.

  HOW THIS PROVES THE LOCK rather than racing it. A raw admin connection stands in
  for the other node — more faithful than a second TaskStore, because it bypasses
  every in-process lock by construction. It takes the SAME per-task advisory lock
  and HOLDS it in an open transaction. The move must then block: if
  `moves.ts` no longer acquires the lock before its capacity read, the move settles
  immediately while the other node holds it, and the "still pending" assertion
  fails. Releasing the lock lets the move proceed and be correctly refused.

  The key comes from the exported `taskAdvisoryLockKey`, NOT a literal restated
  here. A guard that restates the convention it is checking is how the R1 sentinel
  survived: both ends had the shared constant available and one still wrote its own.
