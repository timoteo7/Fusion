/**
 * FNXC:ResearchStore 2026-06-28-11:40:
 * PostgreSQL integration coverage for the research-run EXECUTION store-access path.
 * A created research run previously stayed "queued" forever in PG backend mode because
 * the engine's ResearchOrchestrator/ResearchRunDispatcher were instanceof-gated to the
 * sync EventEmitter ResearchStore and called its methods synchronously. The orchestrator
 * now types `store` as `ResearchStore | AsyncResearchStore` and `await`s every store call,
 * so a queued run advances queued→running→completed (or →failed on a thrown step) and the
 * status/results/events PERSIST through the AsyncDataLayer-backed AsyncResearchStore.
 *
 * This drives the REAL engine ResearchOrchestrator (imported from engine SOURCE so it
 * reflects the current port, not a possibly-stale dist build) against embedded PG with a
 * STUBBED step runner (NO real AI / network). It asserts:
 *   - happy path: queued→running→completed, results persisted (summary/findings/citations),
 *     a source persisted, startedAt/completedAt set, phase-changed events recorded.
 *   - failure path: a step runner that yields no sources drives the run to a persisted
 *     `failed` status with an error event (mirrors "no provider configured" failing cleanly
 *     instead of throwing an unhandled error).
 * Intended for the blocking PG gate (the orchestrator wires it into package.json).
