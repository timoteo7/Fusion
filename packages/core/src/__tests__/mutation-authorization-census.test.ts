FNXC:IdentityStoreMutations 2026-08-09-03:04:
U5/R17 — the mutation-authorization census.

Purpose: make "a new gated mutation shipped with no permission" a CI failure instead of a silent
allow. Without it the map rots in the one direction nobody notices, because a missing entry does not
throw anywhere — the method simply is not authorized, and the system looks like it works.

This suite deliberately asserts the census MECHANISM as well as its current result. A census that
cannot fail is a rubber stamp, and the failure mode is invisible: it reports "0 unmapped" whether
the map is complete or the scan is broken.
