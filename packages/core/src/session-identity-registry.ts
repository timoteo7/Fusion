FNXC:SessionIdentity 2026-07-26-12:05:
Security incident follow-up (agent autonomously deleted a live task): pi's
ExtensionContext carries no agent identity, so host-extension (@runfusion/fusion)
tools could never distinguish "human operator at the CLI" from "engine-spawned
agent session" — every destructive fn_* tool ran as an implicit operator.
Engine agent sessions execute IN-PROCESS via pi's DefaultResourceLoader, but the
extension is a separately bundled module (core is inlined into the CLI bundle),
so ordinary module state is NOT shared between engine and extension. globalThis
is the only reliable in-process channel; this registry lives there under a
versioned key.

Trust model: only the engine process can write this registry (agents cannot
reach the engine's globalThis), so a PRESENT entry is authoritative proof that
the cwd belongs to an engine-managed agent session. Ambiguity (two live
sessions sharing one cwd, e.g. heartbeat lanes at the project root) fails
CLOSED — callers must treat "ambiguous" as an agent principal, never as an
operator. The `runWithFusionSessionIdentity` async-context path takes
precedence over the cwd registry entirely.

FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (KTD16):
The ABSENT case is the one that changed, and it is the only one that changed.
It used to return `{kind:"operator"}` by documented design — "a human terminal
has no engine registration". Under an actor model that reads as: an
UNREGISTERED CALLER IS SILENTLY AN ADMINISTRATOR, and an agent running in a cwd
the engine failed to register is classified as a human. Absence of evidence was
being treated as evidence of a human.

So absence now resolves to `{kind:"unresolved"}` — we do not know who this is —
but ONLY while `identity.enabled` is on. The gate is a dependency-order
requirement, not caution: the operator-as-absence default is load-bearing for
human CLI pass-through, and its replacement is U11's CLI credential, which
depends on U9 -> U5 -> this unit. Inverting ungated here would deny human CLI
users for three phases. When identity is off, absence still resolves to
`operator` and today's behavior is bit-for-bit preserved.

Note for accuracy: this resolver never failed open uniformly. Ambiguity already
failed closed and the context path already took precedence; only the
unregistered-cwd branch defaulted to operator, and only that branch is inverted.
