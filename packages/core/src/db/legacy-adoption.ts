FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-19-12:00 (U9 / R10 / KTD-8):
Every pre-cutover task row must wake OWNED — no silently frozen rows. Because
`task.status` is an OPEN string (not a closed enum), the adoption contract is
derived from a WRITE-SITE CENSUS: the completeness assertion in
legacy-adoption.test.ts greps every task.status write literal in every non-test .ts
source under core/engine/dashboard src (recursive scan, PR #2341 review) and
fails the build if any lacks an adoption row here. So a status added during the
cutover window fails the build instead of mass-parking rows `paused` at upgrade.

Adoption action per legacy status (KTD-8), for the FOUNDATIONAL targets (U9 scope A):
  - resume-graph   : clear a legacy status whose writers the cutover DELETED so the
                     graph re-enters cleanly at the owning node
                     (plan-review-unavailable → plan-review retry,
                     triaged → scheduler re-pickup). NEVER a status with a live
                     post-cutover writer — those are `preserve` (see the FN-8504
                     incident note on the table).
  - preserve       : a live human/terminal gate the graph must NOT disturb
                     (awaiting-approval, awaiting-user-input, failed, error,
                     blocked, done, cancelled). Pausing is NOT a status: it is
                     the boolean `task.paused` field, which no adoption action
                     touches except the explicit park-paused write — so there
                     is deliberately no "paused" adoption row.
  - clear          : a transient in-flight status with no durable meaning post-
                     restart — clear to null and let normal dispatch resume.
  - park-paused    : UNMAPPABLE — an unknown status parks `paused` with a
                     `task:reconcile-legacy-adoption-unmappable` audit for a human.

The execute-seam (in-progress + live steps) and in-review merge-substate
(merging/merging-pr/merging-fix) adoption rows are marked `resume-graph`.

FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-19-05:20 (U9b resolution):
U9 deferred these to U9b "to refine the exact node". U9b's finding: `resume-graph` is the
CORRECT final answer, not a placeholder. Naming an exact re-entry node here would require
resolving the task's workflow IR, which this module deliberately cannot do — it is pure and
storage-agnostic so both consumers (store-open reconcile and the self-healing startup
sweep) can share one decision. Clearing the legacy substate hands the row back to the graph
runner, which resolves its own owning node from the task's actual IR. That is strictly more
correct than a hard-coded node id, which would go stale the moment a workflow is edited —
exactly the drift KTD-3's IR pin exists to catch. Keep them `resume-graph`.

gap with a single pure planner that both consumers (store-open reconcile and the

a legacy row means.

Idempotency rule: only a plan that MUTATES stamps `legacyAdoptedAt`. `preserve` is a
deliberate no-op (a live human/terminal gate), and stamping it would mean mass-writing
every `done` row on first boot after upgrade. Re-evaluating a preserve row each boot is
