// ── Hook implementation DI seam (core→engine) ───────────────────────────────

// Implementations of trait hooks are NOT defined in core (core is engine-free).
// The engine registers them via `registerTraitHookImpl` the way it wires
// `setCreateFnAgent`. Core resolves an implementation through
// `getTraitHookImpl`; an unregistered hook resolves to a no-op (the registry's
// `resolveTraitHook` returns a no-op + an audit warning, see trait-registry).
//
// The impl signature is intentionally opaque here: core never invokes hooks
// directly (the store/sweep do, in engine-adjacent code), so core only needs to
// store/retrieve the registration. Using `unknown` keeps core free of engine
// types while remaining type-safe at the registration boundary.
