FNXC:PlanReviewReplan 2026-08-10-18:32:
Built-in ceiling for consecutive Plan Review REVISE -> replan cycles when the resolved revision budget
is unbounded, used when the `planReviewReplanCap` workflow value is unset.

15 preserves the ceiling that was ACTUALLY in force before this constant existed. That backstop was
`PLAN_REVIEW_FEEDBACK_HISTORY_LIMIT` — a bound on how much reviewer PROSE is replayed into the next
planning prompt, whose own comment states it is "bounded independently of persistence and retry
accounting". Two unrelated concerns were sharing one number, so trimming the prompt history would have
silently tightened a safety ceiling. Splitting them is the point; the value is held at 15 so the split
is a pure re-wiring rather than a silent behavior change. Operators can now lower it, which is what the
`planReviewReplanCap` setting always claimed to do but never did — nothing read it.

 * literals; intentional product-default changes must update both together.
 *
 * `BUILTIN_TRIAGE_POLICY_SETTINGS` is workflow-native triage/spec policy. These
 * keys never lived in `DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS`, are NOT part of the U4
 * hard-move migration, must never be added to `MOVED_SETTINGS_KEYS`, and must
 * not appear in project/global settings schemas. Canonical values are inherited
 * from the post-FN-6232 planning prompt: subtask step threshold `7` (not the
 * older engine copy) and packages/modules threshold `3`. Fast-mode policy is
 * workflow-native here too: `leanPlanning` selects the lean planning variant,
 * and `autoApproveSpec` skips the independent spec reviewer.
 *
 * `BUILTIN_REVIEW_REVISION_SETTINGS` is workflow-native review-loop policy.
 * These keys also never lived in project/global settings and intentionally omit
 * declaration defaults: an unset workflow value means unbounded remediation.

Default is `important` (not `all`) to avoid noisy-by-default behavior. This setting stays workflow-native (out of project/global settings schemas and `MOVED_SETTINGS_KEYS`) and resolves through the generic `resolveEffectiveSettings` default path with no special-casing.

- The task will require MORE THAN {{triageSubtaskStepThreshold}} implementation steps
- The task affects MORE THAN {{triageSubtaskPackageThreshold}} different packages/modules with distinct concerns (a typed field change that naturally touches core types + store + UI + tests is NOT 4 distinct concerns — it's one coherent change)
- Any single step would take more than 1-2 hours to complete
- The task has multiple clearly independent deliverables that could be developed and shipped in parallel by different people

**Splitting guidance:**
- Even when \`breakIntoSubtasks\` is not set to \`true\`, apply these thresholds proactively
- Keep explicit user intent first: when \`breakIntoSubtasks: true\`, follow the mandatory breakdown flow above
- Size S tasks should NOT be split — the overhead outweighs the benefit
- A task with 7-10 focused steps within a coherent scope is fine as one unit; do not split it
- Coordination overhead (worktrees, dependency wiring, merge sequencing) is real — only split when the parallelism or scope-clarity benefit clearly outweighs it
- If you decide not to split an M/L task, proceed with a normal PROMPT.md specification

**Broad-scope decomposition signals:**
- Size L tasks, especially when the planned step count would reach {{triageSubtaskLargeStepSignal}} or more.
- Plans whose implementation-step count would reach {{triageSubtaskAdditiveStepSignal}} or more (additive signal — counts even when the surrounding step-count threshold above has not yet fired).
- Tasks whose declared \`## File Scope\` would list {{triageSubtaskFileScopeThreshold}} or more entries.
- Descriptions that quantify large remediation batches (for example "47 failing tests", "30+ broken files") at or above {{triageSubtaskRemediationBatchThreshold}} items — treat as a strong signal that the work should be partitioned by subsystem or file group before specifying.
- When two or more of the signals above fire together, default to splitting via \`fn_task_create\`. If you still choose to keep the task as a single unit, justify the decision explicitly in the PROMPT.md \`## Mission\` paragraph.`;
