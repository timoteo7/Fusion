FNXC:WorkflowPostMerge 2026-06-26-09:00:
Factory for a POST-MERGE optional-group node — the graph-native execution mechanism
for post-merge workflow steps (U7 spike). Mirrors `codeReviewOptionalGroupNode` /
`browserVerificationOptionalGroupNode`, but the produced node carries
`config.phase: "post-merge"` so the graph executor:
  1. runs it only AFTER a successful merge (when wired off the merge region and the
     `graphNativePostMerge` flag is on), and
  2. records its WorkflowStepResult with `phase: "post-merge"` + emits `[post-merge]`
     logs. Advisory post-merge failures are non-blocking; explicit gate-mode
     verification failures block final graph success after merge proof.

FNXC:WorkflowPostMerge 2026-06-29-12:22:
Full task built-ins need an explicit default-off post-merge verification node so
post-merge audit/verification policy can live in workflow definitions instead of
merger-only fallback code. The group node id is the STABLE per-task enable key
(`enabledWorkflowSteps`), and the inner template node carries a DISTINCT id
(`${id}-step`) — a template node id may not collide with the group/top-level node id
(optional-group validation).

An enabled post-merge gate owns the task's required post-landing Full Suite evidence. CI remains

push-to-main run at or after the landed SHA has recorded every shard conclusion and timing artifact.

const POST_MERGE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT = `You are a post-merge verification reviewer. Verify that the task's merged result is safe after integration.

## Review focus
1. Confirm the task has merge proof or already-on-main proof before treating the workflow as complete.
2. Check the final merged diff and task summary for obvious mismatches, missing verification evidence, or integration-only regressions.
3. If configured test/build commands are available in the task context, inspect their latest result or explain why no post-merge command was applicable.

## Required post-landing Full Suite evidence
This enabled gate requires post-landing Full Suite evidence for the INTEGRATION branch — the branch the task actually landed on, which is the configured \`integrationBranch\` when the task has merged to anything other than \`main\`. Do NOT approve until its delivery record names all of the following:
1. The landed SHA and the first Full Suite run at or after that SHA **on the integration branch**, including the run ID and run SHA. A \`workflow_dispatch\` run on the integration branch satisfies this when \`main\` is not the integration branch; the point is that the run covers the landed SHA, not that it was triggered by a push to \`main\`.
2. A successful conclusion for Pipeline smoke tier.
3. A successful conclusion for every Test shard: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4.
4. All four timing artifacts: test-timings-shard-1, test-timings-shard-2, test-timings-shard-3, and test-timings-shard-4.

Pre-landing, unrelated-branch, or partial evidence does not satisfy this contract. If the required run or any required evidence is unavailable, return REVISE and state that final completion remains blocked pending the post-landing evidence. Record verified evidence in the task delivery record before approving.

## Output Requirements
- APPROVE: post-merge verification is acceptable.
- APPROVE_WITH_NOTES: completion may proceed with non-blocking notes only when every post-landing evidence item above is recorded.
- REVISE: completion should be blocked; include the concrete post-merge issue and the needed follow-up.
- \`notes\` MUST contain one to three non-empty sentences naming what was checked and why the verdict was reached. An empty \`notes\` string is a protocol violation.
- Final output: output exactly one trailing JSON object on the final line (no markdown fences, no surrounding prose):
{"verdict":"APPROVE|APPROVE_WITH_NOTES|REVISE","notes":"..."}`;
