FNXC:MergeAuthority 2026-08-23-18:05 (FN-9193 wedge):
THE MERGE REGION IS THE GRAPH'S MERGE AUTHORITY. A card whose active continuation sits on one of
these nodes has been authorized by its workflow to merge; a card anywhere else has not, no matter
what its column, steps, or status say.

This set is the canonical spelling. `INTERPRETER_ENTRY_NODE_KINDS` (workflow-ir.ts) is the same
membership and now re-exports it. Two NEARBY sets are deliberately different and must not be folded
in: `MERGE_CLASS_NODE_KINDS` (save-time merge-blocker reachability) drops `pr-create`/`pr-respond`
because neither clears a merge-blocker gate, and `MERGE_REGION_NODE_KINDS`
(workflow-lifecycle-validation.ts) drops every `pr-*` kind because it describes the engine-owned
policy region only. Admission needs the widest reading — a card parked at `pr-respond` IS inside its
workflow's merge lane and its merge may legitimately be re-driven.

  FNXC:PostMergeGateMergeRegion 2026-10-01:
  A REQUIRED post-merge evidence gate is an `optional-group` whose `phase` is "post-merge" and whose
  template carries a `gateMode: "gate"` inner node — the same shape
  `getRequiredPostMergeEvidenceBlocker` reads to decide the gate is mandatory.

  It is missing from the set above, and that omission closes a cycle: auto-merge finalization
  re-arms the unreported gate as a `runnable` continuation so it can run before finalization, but
  the merge sweep only admits continuations whose node classifies as merge-region. Classified
  "outside-merge-region", the re-armed item is dropped, the gate never reports, the next
  finalization re-arms it again, and the card is parked forever with
  "required post-merge evidence gate 'post-merge-verification' has not reported".

  Scope is deliberately narrow: only a post-merge optional-group in gate mode, and only when its
  own config says so. A post-merge group in advisory mode stays outside the region — advisory
  evidence is not merge authority, and admitting it would let an advisory note drive a merge.
