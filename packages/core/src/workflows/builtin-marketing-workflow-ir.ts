/**
 * FNXC:WorkflowMarketing 2026-06-20-00:00:
 * Fusion needs a non-coding built-in workflow for marketing and content work. Keep the engine pipeline unchanged by reusing the standard lifecycle trait vocabulary and the canonical merge-primitive region while exposing marketing-specific columns and prompts for brief, draft, and editorial review phases.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowMarketing 2026-06-21-12:00:
 * FN-6906 expands non-coding workflow prompts so marketing agents produce structured, high-quality artifacts instead of thin role-only responses. Deliverable-producing nodes must persist the reviewable content with fn_task_document_write as the guaranteed path and may register a previewable artifact with fn_artifact_register when that tool is available.

The copy should be clear, audience-specific, factual, and ready for editorial review; avoid generic filler, unverified claims, and off-brief tangents. Persist the finished content as a task document using fn_task_document_write with key \"marketing-draft\" so the human can review it.
