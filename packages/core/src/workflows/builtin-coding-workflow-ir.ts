/**
 * The built-in default workflow as a v2 IR. Its six columns have ids that are
 * EXACTLY the legacy enum values in legacy order (KTD-1), so a task with no
 * workflow selection resolves here and its stored `column` value is already a
 * valid column id — migration rewrites zero task rows.
 *
 * Trait ids are plain strings (the trait registry ships in U2); the mapping
 * reproduces legacy behavior verbatim (R12):
 *   triage      = intake
 *   todo        = hold(capacity) + reset-on-entry
 *   in-progress = wip + abort-on-exit + timing
 *   in-review   = merge-blocker + human-review + stall-detection + merge
 *   done        = complete
 *
 * The lifecycle seam nodes are placed in their columns. Planning is explicit so
 * the built-in workflow owns the specification phase rather than relying on
 * triage code that runs outside the graph; execute/review/merge keep the same
 * observable pipeline and failure routing.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowOptionalGroup 2026-06-21-15:10:
 * The pre-merge optional `browser-verification` step is now an `optional-group`
 * container node (default OFF) sitting on the success path between execute and
 * review — REPLACING the legacy `workflow-step` seam node + the execution-inert
 * `optionalSteps: [{ templateId: "browser-verification" }]` declaration (U6). A
 * task whose `enabledWorkflowSteps` includes the group id runs browser
 * verification pre-merge exactly as before; a task with it off bypasses it.

    FNXC:WorkflowExecutionOwnership 2026-07-29-09:20 (U8 / R4 — workflow-owned lifecycle):
    THE PENDING-REVIEW PARK, as a graph node.

    An implementation session can end because a step is blocked on a pending review: the agent
    cannot continue, and the card belongs in review rather than in an error bucket (marking it
    failed deadlocks a row that is both `in-review` and `failed`). Until now the EXECUTOR
    performed that transition inline, mid-session, and the graph found out afterwards — which is
    why `handleGraphFailure` carries `alreadyFinalizedToReview`, a classifier whose only job is
    recognising a move the graph did not make.

    Declaring it here makes the ending a routed outcome instead of a side effect. It is a
    `review-handoff` seam (a pure lifecycle handoff, no reviewer invocation) and its only edge is
    to `end`, which is what preserves today's semantics exactly: hand the card to review and STOP.
    Routing to the ordinary `review` node instead would have been wrong in a way worth recording —
    the run would continue into merge-gate and merge-attempt on work whose steps are incomplete.
