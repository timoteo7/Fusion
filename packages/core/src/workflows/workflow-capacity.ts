 * /moveSource). This module is the pure resolution layer shared by both the
 * in-txn check (`store.ts`) and the hold/release sweep (`@fusion/engine`
 * `hold-release.ts`): given a workflow IR + a column id + settings it answers
 *   - does this column have a `wip` (capacity) trait?
 *   - what is its effective limit (read-through to `settings.maxConcurrent` for
 *     the default workflow's in-progress column so the legacy knob keeps working
 *     — U6 scheduler-integration half)?
 *   - does its config opt into counting mid-`transitionPending` cards?
 *
 * It performs NO DB access and NO counting — the caller owns the count (the
 * store counts in-txn; the sweep counts from a listTasks snapshot). Keeping the
 * resolution pure means the two enforcement points can never disagree on what a
 * limit *is*, only on the live count, which is exactly the serialization the

FNXC:CapacityModel 2026-07-28-11:20:
THE one place "are worktrees a capacity dimension for this project?" is answered.

The capacity model is two configurable numbers per project:
  1. total agents  (`maxConcurrent`)  — always binds
  2. `maxWorktrees`                   — binds ONLY when worktrees are enabled

When `worktreeLimitEnabled === false` the operator asked for "limit via total agents
only". This returns `null` for that case, and callers construct NO worktree gate
at all — rather than a gate with a very high or infinite limit. That distinction
is the whole point: a limiter that still exists and merely happens not to bind is
the bug class this program keeps excavating (the pool-id sentinel that never
matched a real pool; the approval gate three surfaces re-derived; the always-true
flag whose "disabled" branch was the live one). An absent gate cannot silently
start binding again; a gate holding `Infinity` can, the moment someone "fixes" a
comparison. `ConcurrencyGateDiagnostic.maxWorktreesGate` is therefore OPTIONAL,
so consulting a worktree limit in OFF mode does not type-check.

Deliberately NOT expressed as `maxWorktrees === 0`. Zero is a legible number that
already means something to the gate (`used >= 0` is true on an empty board, so a
0 limit deadlocks dispatch rather than disabling it) and the Command Center
slider clamps it to a 1..50 range. Overloading a value as a mode is how sentinels
become defects; the boolean says what it means.

── AUDITED: the one other consumer of `maxWorktrees`, which does NOT come through here ──

`SelfHealingManager.enforceWorktreeCap()` (packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts) reads
`settings.maxWorktrees` RAW and caps on-disk worktree directories at `2 x` it. Measured: that
is the only remaining raw read that bounds anything; every admission decision resolves through
this function, whose single call site is `scheduler.ts`.

It is deliberately left alone, because it is not the same kind of number. This function answers
"is a worktree a CAPACITY dimension" — an admission question. `enforceWorktreeCap` answers "how
many worktree directories may sit on disk" — a hygiene question, and it only ever removes IDLE
ones. Worktrees still exist on disk in OFF mode (everything runs in a worktree, planning
included), so that bound must keep applying or idle directories accumulate without limit.

Consequence, recorded rather than fixed: with `worktreeLimitEnabled === false` the number still
governs disk retention, so a very small `maxWorktrees` reaps idle worktrees eagerly even though
it gates no admission. The operator scoped this out explicitly ("don't worry about worktrees off
or worktree capacity 0 — that's unimportant"). Do NOT "unify" the two readers on that basis:
routing hygiene through `resolveWorktreeCapacityLimit` would return `null` in OFF mode and
silently remove the disk bound altogether, which is a leak, not a simplification.

`worktree-capacity-limit.test.ts` enforces this as a ratchet: every file bounding on
`maxWorktrees` must be named with a reason, so a future raw admission bound fails instead of
quietly re-limiting a project that turned worktrees off.

FNXC:WorkflowCapacity 2026-07-28-19:05 (pool-id sentinel fix):
THE one place the "no selection → which pool?" convention is expressed.

It exists because the convention was previously restated at each end of the
comparison, and the two restatements disagreed: the COUNTER bucketed
selection-less rows under `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_POOL_ID` while `moves.ts` asked the
counter for pool `"builtin:coding"`. Nothing ever landed in the pool being asked
about, so the count came back 0 and a finite limit could never bind — the
in-transaction capacity gate was structurally dead for every default-workflow
task (Phase A3, R1).

A shared constant alone would NOT have prevented that: both sides had the
constant available and one of them still wrote a literal. Both sides now call
THIS function, so "what pool does a selection-less task belong to" has exactly
one answer and no call site is in a position to disagree with it.

NOT to be confused with `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_ID` ("builtin:coding"). That is a real,
resolvable workflow row id and is the correct fallback when the value is used to
RESOLVE AN IR (as `scheduler.ts` does). This is a bucketing key that deliberately
cannot collide with any workflow id. Using either one in the other's role is the
bug this function exists to make unspellable.

FNXC:WorkflowIdentity 2026-09-14-19:06:
