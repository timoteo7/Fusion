FNXC:CodeReviewStep 2026-06-25-15:00:
Code Review is a DEFAULT-ON but TOGGLEABLE step in the built-in coding and
stepwise-coding workflows: an `optional-group` container node with `defaultOn: true`.
It is part of the existing flows and runs for every coding task by default (the
default-on resolver seeds `code-review` into a new task's enabledWorkflowSteps), yet an
operator can turn it off per task by removing `code-review` from enabledWorkflowSteps —
when disabled the group passes through byte-inert, restoring the exact prior flow.

The group sits on the pre-merge success path (execute → [browser-verification optional]
→ code-review → review). The group node id `code-review` is the STABLE per-task enable
key; the inner template node carries a DISTINCT id (`code-review-step`) because a template
node id may not collide with the group/top-level node id (U1 validation).

The inner node is a blocking gate: a REVISE verdict must stop review/merge until
the executor remediates the finding or the task exhausts its revision budget.

FNXC:CodeReviewStep 2026-06-25-00:00:
U6 deleted the built-in step-template catalog; the inner node's literal
name/description/prompt/toolMode/gateMode are now inlined here directly. These built-ins
are the parity oracle; intentional behavior changes must update this file and the
built-in workflow tests together.

FNXC:CodeReviewStep 2026-06-29-10:42:
Code Review is not advisory. FN-7228 reached merge after Code Review returned REVISE
because the generic built-in was authored as advisory and the graph continued after the
remediation budget was exhausted. Keep browser verification advisory, but make Code
Review a gate so REVISE records a blocking failed workflow step and cannot advance to
review or merge.

FNXC:CodeReviewStep 2026-06-29-17:55:
Code Review REVISE is ordinary repair feedback, not a terminal task failure. FN-7242
exhausted the old built-in three-pass default and parked failed at
`code-review-remediation`; default built-in Code Review must keep recovering until it
passes unless a workflow author explicitly sets a numeric maxRevisions cap.

## Step 1: Read the change
1. Read the full diff against the base branch: \`git diff <base>...HEAD\` (or \`git diff <base>\`). Determine the base from the task context / merge target.
2. Read the changed files in full where the diff is non-trivial, so you see the surrounding code paths the change touches — not just the hunks.

## Step 2: Review focus (the value tests miss)
1. **Correctness / logic bugs** — wrong conditions, inverted boolean/comparison logic, off-by-one, incorrect operator precedence, mishandled return values.
2. **Broken edge cases** — empty/undefined/null inputs, zero/duplicate/boundary values, concurrency and ordering assumptions.
3. **Intent vs implementation** — does the code actually do what the task/PROMPT.md describes? Flag silent scope drift or partial implementations.
4. **Regressions in touched code paths** — does the change break or weaken an existing behavior in the files it edits or their callers?
5. **Error handling** — swallowed errors, unhandled rejections/exceptions, missing validation at trust boundaries, misleading error messages.
6. **Contract / signature changes** — changed function/exported-type signatures, API request/response shapes, or serialization that breaks existing callers.

Be specific: cite \`file:line\` for every finding and explain the concrete failure it causes.

## Output Requirements
- Fast-bail: if the diff is trivial, generated, or out-of-scope for code review (e.g. pure docs/config/formatting with no logic), output {"verdict":"APPROVE","notes":"out of scope: code review"} immediately and stop.
- APPROVE: no correctness concerns; use empty or brief notes.
- APPROVE_WITH_NOTES: shippable. Use this when your findings are all P1/P2 — they are recorded and handed to the implementer without another remediation round.
- REVISE: a correctness bug, regression, or contract break requires changes before merge. Requires at least one \`critical\` finding in \`findings\`; a REVISE without one will be treated as APPROVE_WITH_NOTES.
- Every blocking issue MUST appear as an entry in \`findings\` with its severity and \`filePath\`/\`line\`. Prose in \`notes\` alone does not block.
- Final output: output exactly one trailing JSON object on the final line (no markdown fences, no surrounding prose):
{"verdict":"APPROVE|APPROVE_WITH_NOTES|REVISE","notes":"...","findings":[{"id":"stable-id","title":"concise issue","body":"concrete failure and remediation","filePath":"path/to/file.ts","line":1,"severity":"critical|high|medium|low","resolution":"open|resolved-in-review|superseded"}]}`;
