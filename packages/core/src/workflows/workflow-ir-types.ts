FNXC:WorkflowOptionalGroup 2026-06-21-11:00:
An `optional-group` node is a container (mirroring `foreach`/`loop`) whose `template` subgraph the executor runs once per enabled graph attempt and passes through (skips) when disabled.
Enable state reuses the per-task `enabledWorkflowSteps` facet keyed by the group node id, seeded from `defaultOn` at task creation — this replaces the execution-inert declaration-based optional-steps model (`WorkflowOptionalStep`/`optionalSteps`).
The template itself contains no iteration or internal rework edges (validated in `validateOptionalGroup`). The outer graph may re-enter the group for pre-merge fix/re-review remediation governed by `maxRevisions`.

FNXC:WorkflowOptionalStepRevisionBudget 2026-09-13-04:34:
Optional-group remediation still runs the template once per graph pass, and workflow authors can set a lower per-step `maxRevisions` override for the PRE-merge fix→re-review cycle.
