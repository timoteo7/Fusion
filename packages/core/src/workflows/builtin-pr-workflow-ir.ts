/**
 * The built-in **PR** workflow (U9) — the unified PR-entity lifecycle wired end to
 * end as first-class workflow-graph nodes and edges (R3/R20). It is the headline
 * "wire it end to end" deliverable: a task/group routed through this workflow gets
 * the full create → await-review → respond → auto-merge gate → merge → end
 * lifecycle with no hand-authoring.
 *
 * It mirrors the way `builtin-stepwise-coding-workflow-ir` authors a v2 IR
 * directly (the `linear` helper in `builtin-workflows.ts` only builds simple
 * pipelines). Like every built-in it is read-only, and like the stepwise built-in
 * it is graph-runtime-only: the PR node kinds (`pr-create`/`pr-respond`/`pr-merge`),
 * the hold-based await columns, and the top-level rework loop are interpreter-owned
 * and run on the default workflow graph runtime.
 *
 *   start
 *     → pr-create (in-progress)
 *         outcome:open    → await-review  (hold, external-event release)
 *         outcome:failed  → failed        (hold, manual release) --retry--> pr-create
 *     → await-review  (hold; the bounded-rework REGION HEAD)
 *         event changes-requested → pr-respond
 *         event approved          → auto-merge gate
 *         event conflict          → await-rebase (hold) --conflict-cleared--> await-review
 *         manual force-merge      → pr-merge
 *         manual close            → end          (closed)
 *     → pr-respond
 *         --rework: pushed (bounded by maxReworkCycles)--> await-review
 *         outcome:rework-exhausted → await-review-hold (manual) --> await-review
 *     → gate (auto-merge?)
 *         outcome:auto-on  → pr-merge
 *         outcome:auto-off → await-review (park for manual merge)
 *     → pr-merge
 *         outcome:merged-requested → end   (reconcile corroborates `merged`)
 *         outcome:stale-head       → await-review (re-evaluate against new head)
 *     → end
 *
 * **Await states are hold columns with `external-event`/`manual` release (U4).**
 * The node handlers are fast/idempotent/fail-closed; the long waits (for review,
 * for merge readiness, for a cleared conflict) are the holds. The node-agnostic
 * GitHub reconcile (U4) fires the `github:pr-<event>` external-event releases that
 * advance whichever card is parked in an await hold — the scheduler has zero PR
 * knowledge (R20).
 *
 * **The review→respond loop is the bounded rework cycle (U6).** `await-review` is
 * the top-level rework region head (`config.reworkRegion: true`,
 * `config.maxReworkCycles`); the `pr-respond --rework--> await-review` edge loops
 * up to the cap and then routes `outcome:rework-exhausted` to a manual hold so the
 * card parks instead of looping forever (R8).
 *
 * NOTE (cutover deferral): this is shipped ADDITIVELY — a NEW built-in alongside
 * the default `builtin-coding-workflow`, which is unchanged. Full retirement of
 * the legacy comment/monitor PR path (`PrCommentHandler`, `PrMonitor`,
 * `pr-monitor-gh.ts`) is deferred until the graph executor is the default; the
 * flag-OFF path keeps the current working branch-group/per-task PR flow unchanged.
 * See the plan's "Deferred to follow-up work" note.
