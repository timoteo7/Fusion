/**
 * Default-workflow trait hook implementations (U4).
 *
 * The legacy per-column side effects of `moveTaskInternal` — timing /
 * `cumulativeActiveMs` accounting, reopen field/step resets, in-review
 * auto-merge handoff preparation + merge-queue enqueue, and abort-on-exit
 * (hard-cancel incl. `userPaused` only for user-source moves) — become the
 * default workflow's trait hook
 * implementations, registered through U2's DI seam (`registerTraitHookImpl`).
 *
 * IMPORTANT (per U4): this is the FLAG-ON path. The legacy inline code in
 * `store.ts` is NOT deleted — it IS the flag-off path. The implementations here
 * are a deliberate parallel of that inline logic so the two paths can be parity-
 * checked against each other; "moved, not duplicated" applies to the flag-ON
 * path only.
 *
 * Hook classes (KTD-2):
 *   - guard  (sync, in-lock): merge-blocker, human-review. NOT implemented here.
 *     The header used to credit an `evaluateDefaultWorkflowGuards` reader in this
 *     file; no such function has ever existed. The merge-blocker guard is enforced
 *     inline in `task-store/moves.ts` (~645 and ~821) via `getTaskMergeBlocker`,
 *     gated on the RESOLVED trait flags (`toFacts.flags.complete` +
 *     `fromFacts.flags.mergeBlocker`) rather than on column ids — which is why no
 *     `guard` trait hook is registered below and none is missing.
 *   - onEnter / onExit (mutating, applied in-lock to the in-memory task before
 *     the commit for field effects; queue effects run in-txn): timing,
 *     reset-on-entry, abort-on-exit, merge.
 *
 * Worktree allocation is explicitly NOT a hook (it stays a substrate capability
 * invoked before the move; see store.ts) — there is no `allocateWorktree` hook
 * here by design.
 *
 * The hooks are registered into the shared trait registry on `init` via
 * `registerDefaultWorkflowHooks()` (idempotent). They are resolved through
 * `getTraitRegistry().resolveTraitHook(...)` so a missing registration degrades
 * to a no-op + audit warning rather than crashing.

  Concretely for the timing hook: with a single id, a card moving between two WIP lanes looked like an

  never left — and a card living only in the secondary lane accrued nothing at all.

  Optional and additive: absent, every read falls back to the singular struct and then the legacy id,

`lifecycleColumnSets` is supplied only when the caller resolved a workflow IR, so `set !== undefined`
already means "the board was read". An EMPTY array then says "no column carries this role" — and the
`length > 0` guard treated that as no-basis and fell back to the singular id, then to the legacy name.
The consequence: on a valid v2 workflow with no WIP lane, a traitless column happening to be NAMED
`in-progress` accrued timing as though it were one.

Same shape as #2731 (`?? {}` for resolved-but-roleless flags) and #2733 (refuse rather than invent a
complete column). Undefined means "could not read"; empty means "read, and the answer is none".

 *
 *  FNXC:WorkflowReviewGates 2026-07-26-16:20:
 *  SCOPE: `cumulativeActiveMs` measures time in WIP columns only — it is a sum of `in-progress`
 *  segments, closed on each exit. Since the pre-merge review gates moved into `in-review`, gate
 *  runtime is NOT included: the segment closes when the card crosses into review, and no new
 *  segment opens until remediation re-enters `in-progress`. Read it as "implementation time",
 *  not "wall clock from start to merge" — consumers that want the latter must use immutable
 *  `firstExecutionAt` through `executionCompletedAt`. `executionStartedAt` is only the current
 *  open WIP segment and is cleared as soon as that segment is banked.
 *  Deliberately NOT fixed by adding the `timing` trait to `in-review`: that column also holds the
 *  arbitrary human merge-wait, so counting it would overstate active time by hours of idle
 *  latency — a worse distortion than omitting the gate's own minutes. Attributing gate runtime
 *  properly needs node-scoped timing (a separate field), not a column trait.
 *
 *  FNXC:WorkflowReviewGates 2026-09-16-06:16:
 *  FN-457 — gate runtime IS now restored at the display layer, without changing this scope. The
 *  card's clock chip adds a third bucket computed by `getVerificationRuntimeMs`
 *  (`packages/dashboard/app/utils/taskTiming.ts`) from the gates' own `startedAt`/`completedAt`
 *  windows, unioned so overlapping `foreach` instances count once. That is the node-scoped timing
 *  the paragraph above says the problem needs, taken from durable `workflowStepResults` rather than
 *  from a new field, so no idle merge-wait is swept in.
 *  `cumulativeActiveMs` keeps its "implementation time" meaning EXACTLY as written above, and the
 *  Plan Review gate stays counted as PLANNING, not verification, because it opens a
 *  `planningStartedAt` segment and is therefore already inside `cumulativePlanningMs`.
 *  Consumers of this scope: `packages/core/src/productivity-analytics.ts`,
 *  `packages/core/src/task-timing.ts`, and the dashboard duration displays.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-08:05 (Phase C convergence — reopen semantics):

WHAT A "REOPEN" IS, stated once. A card leaving live work (wip / review / complete) for a
PLANNING lane (intake or hold). The three predicates below were each written as a list of
the default lineage's column names, which meant every reopen effect — status/error clear,
step reset, `workflowStepResults` clear, branch clear — was a no-op on any workflow that
renamed its columns.

THE CONSEQUENCE WAS NOT COSMETIC. `getTaskMergeBlocker` reads `workflowStepResults`; the
executor's documented bounce invariant is "moveTask(in-review -> planning) clears ALL
results". On a renamed board that clear never happened, so a card bounced out of review
and back in carried its OLD review results — and a `passed` result satisfies the merge
gate. A renamed workflow could merge with its re-review never run. That is the same
safety regression the graph-owned-crossing carve-out above was written to prevent,
arriving through the other door.

LEGACY IDS ARE A NO-BASIS FALLBACK, NOT A ROLE. When the struct is undefined (a v1 IR
with no column vocabulary) there is nothing to reason from and the legacy names are all
we have. When the struct EXISTS but a role is absent, the workflow genuinely has no such
lane and no substitution is made — that is the distinction `resolveLifecycleColumns`
