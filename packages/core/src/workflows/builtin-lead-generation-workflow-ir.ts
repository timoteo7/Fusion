/**
 * FNXC:Workflows 2026-06-20-00:25:
 * The lead-generation built-in must be a first-class v2 workflow with its own business pipeline columns, lead-specific task fields, and inline per-stage prompts instead of coding seams.
 * The custom non-default column ids make this workflow graph-executor-oriented at runtime while still compiling its linear prompt/gate spine for legacy step materialization.
 *
 * FNXC:Workflows 2026-06-21-12:00:
 * FN-6906 expands each lead-generation stage prompt with explicit inputs, output structure, and quality bars so non-coding agents produce reviewable business artifacts. Enrichment and outreach deliverables must be persisted with fn_task_document_write as the guaranteed path and can additionally use fn_artifact_register when that previewable-artifact tool is available.
