FNXC:WorkflowStepResults 2026-07-09-00:20:
FN-7727: both engine `WorkflowStepResult` recorders (the executor graph adapter's
`recordWorkflowStepResult` and triage's `recordPlanReviewWorkflowResult`) used to
upsert by `workflowStepId` with a bare `existing[idx] = result` replace-in-place.
When self-healing (`recoverFailedPreMergeWorkflowStep` /
`recoverReviewTasksWithFailedPreMergeSteps`) sends a failed pre-merge review step
back for fix and the graph re-runs that same node, the new attempt silently
overwrote the prior `status:"failed"` record — losing its `output`/`notes`/
`verdict`/timestamps forever. This shared, PURE helper is the single upsert path
for every recorder: it snapshots a replaced `failed`/`advisory_failure` entry into
the new entry's `priorAttempts` (bounded, oldest-dropped, single-level — snapshots
never carry their own nested `priorAttempts`), and carries forward already-
accumulated history across successive re-runs. `priorAttempts` is read-only
history: callers that select "the current failed step" (self-healing selection,
`getTaskMergeBlocker`, progress/timing) must keep reading the top-level array
entries only and never flatten/inspect `priorAttempts` for that purpose.

  immediately instead of waiting out the staleness floor — the floor exists to protect leases we
  cannot attribute, and this one we can.

  Deliberately narrow, because every widening is a double-dispatch risk:
  - `leaseNodeId` must be PRESENT and EQUAL to ours. Absent (legacy rows) or a peer's id both keep
    the floor — under multi-node, a fresh peer lease is very likely genuinely running.
  - `startedAt` must parse and be STRICTLY before boot. A lease taken by this process after boot is
    a live in-process claim and must still be adopted.
  Motivating incident FN-8603: an engine restart killed a Code Review session 34s in; the lease then
  read "fresh" for the remaining ~14 minutes of the floor, so nothing re-ran the gate until it aged
