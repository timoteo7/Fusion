FNXC:WorkflowIrPin 2026-07-18-20:20:
KTD-3 — a task pins its resolved workflow IR when it ENTERS a node, and holds
that resolution until the node settles. The pin is a durable seam: the field
lives on the workflow run state (schema wiring lands in U9; this is the in-code
seam U1 adds now). Restart recovery compares the stored pin against the CURRENT
IR and takes the drift-park path on mismatch — the pin survives crashes.

`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` is otherwise live-per-call, so a mid-flight editor
edit that changes the graph under a running task is a determinism hole; the pin
plus `detectWorkflowDrift` closes it. If an edit deleted the pinned node or its
column, the task parks with `task:reconcile-workflow-drift` instead of traversing
a mutated graph.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-12:10 (lifecycle-column census enabler):
WHY PROVENANCE IS A SEPARATE ANSWER FROM THE IR.

`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` answers "which workflow governs this task" by returning the default
coding IR in two cases that are NOT the same as knowing: the selection read threw, and the store
reported no selection at all (the synchronous PostgreSQL path does exactly that). Callers cannot
tell those apart from a genuine selection, and for lifecycle-column work the difference decides
correctness rather than tidiness.

Concretely, and this is what motivated it: post-merge the default coding lineage declares `todo`
as its single Planning column and NO `triage`. So a call site converting a `column === "triage"`
guard to trait resolution silently stops firing for `builtin:legacy-coding` cards whenever the
store cannot name the workflow — the resolver hands back the default's vocabulary and the caller
has no way to know it was a guess. Every such site has so far had to keep the legacy ids unioned
in "just in case", which is exactly why the census stalls instead of converging.

With provenance a caller can say what it actually means: trust the resolved columns when the
workflow was SELECTED, and fall back to legacy compat only when it was GUESSED.

Additive by construction — `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` delegates here and drops the provenance, so
no existing caller changes behavior.

  default's columns wearing the selected workflow's label. That is worse than having no provenance

  lies is one nobody can build the census conversions on.

  Verified by identity, not by hope: a v2 IR carries its own id, so a returned IR whose id is not
  the selected one is a fallback however it arose. A v1/column-less IR carries no id to check, and
  it has no column vocabulary either, so it is reported as a default rather than guessed at.

  THE MARKER IS THE WHOLE ANSWER. An id-equality check used to run after this line, on the reasoning
  that a returned IR whose `id` differs from the requested one proves a fallback. Both halves of that
  are wrong.

  UNRELIABLE. Neither `WorkflowIrV1` nor `WorkflowIrV2` declares an `id` field, so the check is
  answering a question about a property the IR type does not have. When one IS present — a fixture, a
  hand-authored graph, an import — it is the AUTHOR's id and has no relation to the `WF-NNN` the store
  mints, because `createWorkflowDefinition` persists the IR verbatim and allocates the row id
  separately. Measured:

      store workflow id = WF-001   stored ir.id = custom:prov
      -> source reported "default", for a workflow that resolved CORRECTLY

  REDUNDANT. All four ways `resolveWorkflowIrById` substitutes the default — missing definition,
  malformed definition, throwing lookup, and an unregistered builtin id (branded above, in this same
  change) — return a MARKED IR, and the line below returns `"default"` for every one of them.

  The note on `markFellBack` states the principle: "there is no rule over the returned value that
  separates them, because the two shapes are genuinely identical. So the function that KNOWS marks
  it." The id check was an inference over the returned value, which is exactly what that note rules
  out.

  SCOPE, corrected after the first version of this change overstated it: an editor-authored workflow
  carries no `ir.id`, so the check reported `"selection"` for it and the misfire never reached the one
  production consumer (`triage.ts`'s post-U11 intake recovery). The reachable defect this change fixes
  is the unregistered-builtin branding hole above; removing the id check is correctness and clarity,
  not a live bug fix.

  Found while fixing PR #2812, where gating on this signal turned a fixture-built case red.

IS `nodeId` THE TASK'S OWN TERMINAL NODE? Resolved from the task's REAL workflow.

The previous answer came from `store.resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync`, which returns the DEFAULT workflow
IR for every task under PostgreSQL, so it answered about a board the card is not on. On a workflow
whose terminal node is not called `end` that inverted the FN-7641 guard in both directions: a
legitimate override to a non-terminal node named `end` was rejected as a terminal finalize, and an
override to the board's REAL terminal node was written verbatim — the silent no-op FN-7641 exists to
prevent. Proven end to end in `workflow-terminal-node-sync-resolution-live-e2e.pg.test.ts`.

FAIL-SOFT TO THE LITERAL, deliberately: an unresolvable workflow keeps exactly the pre-conversion
answer rather than losing the guard. `end` is also every builtin's terminal node id, so the fallback
is correct wherever it can still be reached.

RESIDUAL, stated because a review raised it and the obvious remedy does not work yet (PR #2812):
`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` DEGRADES to the default workflow instead of throwing, so the `catch` above
does not cover a failed lookup — a task on a custom board whose definition cannot be loaded is judged
against the default graph. The natural fix is to gate on
`resolveWorkflowIrForTaskWithProvenance(...).source === "selection"`, and that signal is currently
unusable: `createWorkflowDefinition` stores an authored IR VERBATIM, so its `ir.id` keeps whatever the
author wrote while the store allocates its own `WF-NNN`. The provenance identity check then compares
those two and reports `source: "default"` for a workflow it resolved CORRECTLY. Measured, not
assumed — gating on it here turned the "non-terminal override is written" case red.

So the residual is knowingly left: it is the pre-existing fail-soft, not a regression this change
introduces, and narrowing it depends on fixing the provenance signal first.
