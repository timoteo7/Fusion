FNXC:ProviderAuth 2026-07-24-17:05:
Anthropic credentials can be present twice at once: a raw API key AND a Claude
subscription OAuth login. Runtime auth resolution has to pick one, and until now the raw
key always won silently — an operator who logged in with their subscription but had an old
(or revoked) key saved kept getting `401 invalid x-api-key` from lanes that call the
Anthropic endpoint directly, with nothing in the UI explaining which credential was in use.
This preference makes the choice explicit and operator-owned. It is GLOBAL because
credentials live in the global `~/.fusion/agent/auth.json`, not per project.
Default "api-key" preserves the historical precedence (FN-7391/FN-7396), so upgrading
changes no existing behavior.
