 * `TaskLogEntry.runContext`, so who-did-it lands in the same row as which-run-did-it rather than in
 * a parallel structure that can drift. A store instance cannot carry the actor instead:
 * packages/cli/src/extension.ts caches ONE TaskStore per project root on `globalThis`, shared across
 * concurrent agent sessions, so a store-level field would be whichever session wrote it last.
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` is ambient convenience only — it loses context across raw callbacks,
 * EventEmitters, and custom thenables, all of which the engine is full of — so the explicit field is
 * the backstop that turns a lost context into a type error instead of a silent fail-open.
 *
 * `actor` is REQUIRED. Making the field required is this unit's job; making the `runContext?`
 * PARAMETER required across the ~70 mutating store methods is U18's, and the two are split
 * deliberately so a large mechanical diff does not hide inside a semantic one. Until U18 lands, a
 * call site that passes no context at all still passes no context — the required field only
 * constrains the sites that construct one.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-10:55 (Phase C convergence — vocabulary hygiene):

A ROLE IS NOT A COLUMN, and the string `"triage"` names both. The planning LANE — the engine
service, its prompt templates, its usage-limit accounting — is called `triage` in the
AgentRole vocabulary, and that name is not going anywhere: U11 removed the `triage` COLUMN
from the default lineage, not the planner lane.

This constant exists so those comparisons stop reading as un-migrated column guards. The
lifecycle-column census greps `=== "triage"`, and `role === "triage"` / `agentType ===
"triage"` matched it — sending reviewers to sites that were never column guards while the
pattern simultaneously MISSED real guards whose locals were named `from` or `originColumn`.
Naming the role makes the two vocabularies distinguishable by grep, which is the only way a
census over a shared string can be trusted.

Use this at every role comparison. If you are comparing a task's COLUMN, you want a lifecycle
role resolved from the workflow IR (`resolveLifecycleColumns`), not this.

FNXC:AgentLog-EntryTypes 2026-07-15-11:20:
`text` means a STREAMED DELTA FRAGMENT: renderers re-glue consecutive `text` rows with `join("")` and no separator, because that is the only way to reconstitute a streamed message (the FN-5787/5789/5803 streamed-spacing lineage). `AgentLogger` is the only producer of true deltas.

`status` means a COMPLETE, SELF-CONTAINED engine message (e.g. "Reviewer using model: x/y", "Deterministic merge verification passed") written directly by an engine lane rather than streamed from a model. It exists because engine lanes previously wrote these as `text`, so N consecutive standalone messages were glued edge-to-edge into one run-on string under an accurate-but-misleading "N entries" header.

Never emit `status` for model-streamed output, and never emit `text` for a whole standalone message. Renderers must render each `status` row as its own block and must never `join("")` them. Rows written before this type existed persist as `text`, so read paths that resolve engine markers out of the log must accept BOTH types (see dashboard effective-model-resolution.ts).
