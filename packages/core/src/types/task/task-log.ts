FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-10:55 (Phase C convergence — vocabulary hygiene):

A ROLE IS NOT A COLUMN, and the string `"triage"` names both. The planning LANE — the engine
service, its prompt templates, its usage-limit accounting — is called `triage` in the
AgentRole vocabulary, and that name is not going anywhere: U11 removed the `triage` COLUMN
from the default lineage, not the planner lane.

This constant exists so those comparisons stop reading as un-migrated column guards. The
lifecycle-column census greps `=== "triage"`, and `role === "triage"` / `agentType ===
"triage"` matched it — sending reviewers to sites that were never column guards while the
pattern simultaneously MISSED real guards whose locals were named `from` or `originColumn`.
Naming the role makes the two vocabularies distinguishable by grep, which is the only way a
census over a shared string can be trusted.

Use this at every role comparison. If you are comparing a task's COLUMN, you want a lifecycle
role resolved from the workflow IR (`resolveLifecycleColumns`), not this.

FNXC:AgentLog-EntryTypes 2026-07-15-11:20:
`text` means a STREAMED DELTA FRAGMENT: renderers re-glue consecutive `text` rows with `join("")` and no separator, because that is the only way to reconstitute a streamed message (the FN-5787/5789/5803 streamed-spacing lineage). `AgentLogger` is the only producer of true deltas.

`status` means a COMPLETE, SELF-CONTAINED engine message (e.g. "Reviewer using model: x/y", "Deterministic merge verification passed") written directly by an engine lane rather than streamed from a model. It exists because engine lanes previously wrote these as `text`, so N consecutive standalone messages were glued edge-to-edge into one run-on string under an accurate-but-misleading "N entries" header.

Never emit `status` for model-streamed output, and never emit `text` for a whole standalone message. Renderers must render each `status` row as its own block and must never `join("")` them. Rows written before this type existed persist as `text`, so read paths that resolve engine markers out of the log must accept BOTH types (see dashboard effective-model-resolution.ts).
