FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-21-19:05:
R7 workspace merge-boundary guard (master-plan U0). Workspace-mode tasks populate
`task.workspaceWorktrees` (one git worktree per sub-repo); their merge must run a
per-repo loop that does NOT exist yet — it lands in master-plan U6. Until then, a
workspace task reaching ANY merge entry point (engine dispatch, store.mergeTask,
the CLI `onMergeImpl` / `runTaskMerge` callers) would run git operations against
the NON-GIT workspace root and crash. This single shared predicate is called at the
top of every merge door, BEFORE any git work, so the task is held with a clear,
actionable error instead. It lives in @fusion/core so all four call sites — including
store.mergeTask, which cannot import from @fusion/engine — share ONE implementation.
The guard throws a NAMED `WorkspaceTaskMergeError` so callers (e.g. the engine merge
dispatch catch) can distinguish this permanent config error from a transient merge
failure and avoid burning mergeRetries. Master-plan U6 REMOVES this guard when the
per-repo merge loop becomes the gate.
