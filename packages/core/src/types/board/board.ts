/*
FNXC:WorkflowColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8):
`normalizeColumn` is DELETED. It carried one of the two `@deprecated (workflowColumns,
U12)` markers this unit was named for.

It coerced an arbitrary value to a LEGACY column, rewriting every workflow-defined
custom id to `triage` — silent data loss for any project whose workflow declares a
column outside the six built-ins. `normalizeColumnId` (retained, just below) is the
non-lossy replacement: it sanitises structurally (non-string/empty -> fallback) and
passes real ids through untouched.

Deleted rather than left deprecated because it had ZERO callers — the dashboard's
ingest path and move handler both migrated to `normalizeColumnId` when the lossy
behaviour was diagnosed (see `useTasks.ts` and `routes-trait-rekey.test.ts`, which pin
that migration). Leaving an exported lossy coercion next to its safe twin is an
invitation to pick the wrong one; `__tests__/no-lossy-column-coercion-export.test.ts`
now ratchets that shut, by behaviour rather than by name.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowColumns 2026-07-19-2b:00 (U12 / R2 / R11):
The workflow-aware column sanitiser — the one client code should use when
sanitizing a column id off the wire.

The deleted `normalizeColumn` answered "is this one of the SIX legacy ids", so it silently rewrote every
workflow-defined id to `triage`. That is correct only for the closed default-workflow set; applied
to a real board it teleports cards. A custom `merging` column's cards rendered in Triage because
the dashboard ran every task through the legacy coercion on ingest.

The right invariant at a deserialization boundary is narrower: reject only what is structurally
unusable (non-string / empty), and pass every real id through untouched. Membership is not this
function's business — the task's resolved workflow decides that, via `workflowHasColumn`.

FNXC:TaskQueueOrder 2026-09-17-12:07:
FN-509 DELETES the task-priority contract. `TASK_PRIORITIES`, `TaskPriority` and
`DEFAULT_TASK_PRIORITY` are gone: there are no importance levels any more, ordinary queues are
strictly arrival-ordered, and the only forward move is an explicit Boost (see
`tasks/task-queue-order.ts`). Historical SQL columns and archived documents may still physically
hold `"urgent"`/`"normal"` strings, but nothing reads them: they are inert compatibility data and
are never re-emitted as a task field, migrated into a Boost, copied onto a new task, or used to
sort. Do not re-add a level type to satisfy an old fixture.
