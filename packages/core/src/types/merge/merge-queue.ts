  FNXC:WorkflowWorkItemCas 2026-07-27-22:10 (U7, PR #2491 review — greptile P1):
  Compare-and-set guard. When set, the transition is applied ONLY if the row's
  state read INSIDE the transaction still equals this value; otherwise it is a
  no-op that returns the current row unchanged (no write, no run-audit row).

  Why this exists: a caller that decided from a due-poll SNAPSHOT and then writes
  unconditionally can clobber a newer state another node reached in between —
  resetting a `running` claim back to `runnable` (double-claim) is the concrete
  case. The terminal-state check below already refuses cancelled/succeeded/failed,
  so `running` was the unguarded gap. Callers that legitimately force a state
  (the executor's own lifecycle writes) simply omit this and behave as before.

  FNXC:WorkflowWorkItemLeaseCas 2026-09-06-01:28:
  State alone cannot fence a lease renewal because a reclaimed work item can return to `running`

  exact durable owner so an old callback cannot overwrite or complete its successor's lease.

  which cannot know a workflow. Without this the SQL literal deleted every queued row on a renamed
