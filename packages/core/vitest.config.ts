FNXC:CoreTestInventory 2026-07-13-22:38:
Core test exclusions must exactly mirror the dated quarantine ledger. The PostgreSQL cutover removed the SQLite runtime and the expired 2026-07-10 exclusions no longer have ledger authority; keep this list empty and preserve behavior through active PostgreSQL counterparts.

FNXC:FullSuiteBookkeeping 2026-08-09-03:49:
All 14 core entries from the 2026-08-05 full-suite quarantine wave (run 30982276306) were deleted under the deletion ratchet after operator directive. These tested pre-refactor APIs/mock shapes (layer.db.select, peeled workflow IR resolvers, stale serialization literals) that no longer exist post-cutover. Array intentionally empty.
