/**
 * FNXC:PostgresCutover 2026-07-04-00:00:
 * Reusable PostgreSQL fixture + typed mocks for CLI extension (agent-tool) tests.
 *
 * The CLI extension's agent tools resolve their store via `getStore(cwd)`, which
 * the SQLite→PostgreSQL cutover rewired to boot the backend through
 * `createTaskStoreForBackend`. These tests can no longer construct a legacy
 * SQLite `new TaskStore(rootDir)` — that runtime was removed (VAL-REMOVAL-005).
 *
 * This harness reuses core's `createSharedPgTaskStoreTestHarness` (one isolated
 * PG database per describe block, truncated between tests) and injects the
 * resulting store into the extension's per-root cache via
 * `__setCachedStoreForTesting`, so every tool call for the harness rootDir
 * resolves to the SAME PostgreSQL-backed store the test seeds against. No
 * embedded PostgreSQL is started in the test process — the shared external test
 * server (localhost:5432, or FUSION_PG_TEST_URL_BASE) is used, and the whole
 * describe is skipped when PostgreSQL is unreachable (pgDescribe contract).
 *
 * Assert against task state through `store().getTask(id, { includeDeleted: true })`
 * — it returns `deletedAt` and `allowResurrection` for soft-deleted rows in
 * backend mode, so no raw drizzle handle is needed at the CLI layer.

  workflow-owner agents, and that provisioning requires a bound asyncLayer.projectId
  (backendProjectId rejects the empty/unbound partition to avoid mixing ownership on a
  shared PG cluster). Bind this CLI-extension harness to a real projectId end-to-end so the
  connection GUC `fusion.project_id`, the layer's projectId, and the seeded config row all
  agree: agents (explicit project_id) and their config revisions (GUC-default project_id)
  land in the SAME partition, so the (project_id, agent_id) FK on agent_config_revisions holds.
  A project-agnostic bind (projectId "") would split those writes across partitions and
  reintroduce the FN-8764 provisioning throw.
