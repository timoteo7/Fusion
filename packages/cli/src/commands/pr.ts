 * CWD-fallback) and, before this change, NO `runPr*` handler ever closed it
 * — the same leaked-handle class FN-7731 fixed for `fn task show`/`move`.
 * None of the board mutations here (`updatePrInfo`, `ensurePrEntityForSource`,
 * `updatePrEntity`, `releaseHeldTaskByEvent`, `reconcileLegacyAutoMergeStamps`)
 * retried through a momentary `database is locked` either. The fix below
 * reuses the SAME `retryOnLock`/`closeProjectStore` helpers (no forked
 * second implementation), scoped to the discrete store read/write calls —
 * NOT the GitHub API calls (`client.createPr`, `dashboard.generatePrMetadata`)
 * or `releaseHeldTaskByEvent` (which itself owns further workflow/GitHub side
 * effects) — to avoid re-issuing an already-completed external side effect on
 * a later lock-triggered retry. The resolved store is closed on every exit
 * path, including guard/not-found `process.exit()` calls (closed explicitly
 * before the exit, since a pending `finally` does not run after
 * `process.exit()` — see project memory) and including the uncached
 * CWD-fallback branch via `asLocalProjectContext`.

 *
 * Capability → path mapping (kept identical to the dashboard so the two surfaces
 * can never diverge — register-integrated-routers.ts wires the route callbacks to
 * exactly these primitives):
 *
 *   create    → store.ensurePrEntityForSource (same store path the pr-create

 *
 * The release actions fire the workflow's user-controlled release edges — the
 * same hold-release authority the dashboard routes and the scheduler sweep use —
 * so the GitHub side effects are owned by the workflow, not duplicated here.

    A RESOLVED WORKFLOW WITH NO REVIEW LANE IS AN ANSWER, not a missing one.

    My first pass fell back to `'in-review'` for both the unresolvable-workflow case AND the
    resolved-but-no-review-lane case, which reproduced the exact defect this change fixes: the
    refusal named a lane the board does not have. The two cases are different questions and get
    different answers —

      prIr === undefined            → the workflow could not be read at all. Keep the legacy literal;
                                      this is today's behaviour and the only safe default.
      prIr resolved, lanes empty    → the board genuinely declares no review lane. Say so. Inventing
                                      `'in-review'` here sends the operator to a phantom column.

    /*
    FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-21:55 (#2775 review — greptile, "legacy review lane rejected"):
    AN EMPTY REVIEW SET IS NOT AN ANSWER HERE. THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THAT EXCEPTION APPLIES.

    Two review rounds pushed this guard in opposite directions and both were right about their own
    case, so the resolution has to hold both:

      - inventing `'in-review'` whenever the set is empty names a lane a v2 board may not have;
      - refusing whenever the set is empty rejects every V1 workflow.

    The v1 case is the decisive one. `synthesizeDefaultColumns` (workflow-ir.ts:158-159) upgrades a v1
    graph by emitting `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_COLUMN_IDS.map((id) => ({ id, name: id, traits: [] }))` — every
    column, NO traits. So a v1-upgraded workflow resolves to an EMPTY review set while sitting on a
    board whose `in-review` column plainly exists and is where its cards live. Treating empty as "this
    board has no review lane" refuses `fn pr create` for every pre-v2 project — a far worse regression
    than the phantom lane, and one no v2 test would ever surface.

    Empty therefore means UNEXPRESSED, not absent: indistinguishable from a v1 upgrade, so it takes the
    same legacy fallback as an unresolvable workflow. `in-review` is the correct answer for exactly the
    boards that produce an empty set, because those are the ones that declare it by convention.

    The general "an empty resolved set is an answer" rule still holds elsewhere; it fails here only
    because the v1 upgrade path manufactures empty traits for columns that do exist.

      unresolvable            -> legacy id. We know nothing; keep today's behaviour.
      resolved, NO traits     -> legacy id. A v1 upgrade: `synthesizeDefaultColumns` emits every
                                 default column with `traits: []`, so `in-review` plainly exists and
                                 holds the cards. Refusing here would break every pre-v2 project.
      resolved, traits, none  -> REFUSE, and say so. A native v2 board that expresses traits and
        carry review               declares no review lane genuinely has nowhere to open a PR from.
                                 Naming `'in-review'` sends the operator to a column their board does
                                 not have — an impossible instruction, which is the defect this
                                 conversion set out to remove, reappearing in its own fallback.

    `declaresAnyLifecycleTrait` is what separates the middle case from the last; the empty set alone
