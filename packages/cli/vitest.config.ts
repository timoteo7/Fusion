  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-01:36:
  The full @runfusion/fusion package lane timed out or leaked mock state across 24 CLI integration-heavy files under changed-test load, while the same files passed in smaller direct runs.
  They were quarantined per the flaky-test deletion ratchet instead of raising the 5s test timeout or relaxing assertions.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-05:50:
  FN-6427 triaged all 24 quarantined CLI files and kept them in-window: 0 rescued, 0 deleted, 24 kept until the 2026-06-27 and 2026-06-28 deletion deadlines.
  Fresh direct runs passed, and the shared package-load signature needed a broader fixture/concurrency rescue before these high-value suites could safely rejoin the default lane.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-14-01:42:
  FN-6430 rescued all 24 CLI quarantine entries after fixing shared test-isolation cleanup, rejecting inherited HOME roots from other invocations, removing pre-existing file-wide timeout bumps, and narrowing the mission real-store seam.
  Keep this array as an explicit empty rescue ledger so future CLI quarantines add entries in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json instead of resurrecting stale excludes.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-15-04:07:
  FN-6483 observed extension-task-tools timing out only under the full @runfusion/fusion package lane while passing standalone immediately afterward.
  Quarantine the suite for the 14-day deletion ratchet instead of appeasing the load-sensitive timeout with wider test timeouts, retries, or worker changes.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-15-07:46:
  FN-6486 rescued extension-task-tools by closing real TaskStore fixtures and replacing hoisted mock cleanup, then removed the quarantine in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json. Keep this array empty unless a future observed CLI flake is mirrored in the ledger in the same commit.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-19-11:43:
  FN-6705 verification observed five CLI extension-tool files fail under the broad changed-package lane with test timeouts, ENOTEMPTY cleanup, or cross-test state drift; all except extension-task-tools passed in the direct failure-batch rerun, and extension-task-tools remained timeout-sensitive. Quarantine these existing integration-heavy files under the deletion ratchet instead of widening testTimeout, adding retries, or weakening assertions.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-20-09:48:
  FN-6795 reloaded the five remaining 2026-06-19 CLI extension/research quarantines under the full @runfusion/fusion package lane after the FN-6734 close-before-remove seam and found no timeout, ENOTEMPTY, or cross-test state drift. Keep this exclude list empty in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json; future CLI load flakes must prove a new cleanup invariant before quarantine.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-20-10:04:
  FN-6795 final loaded verification re-exposed extension-task-tools, extension.test's built-dist-barrel case, and bin's no-args dashboard launch as package-lane-only timeouts while targeted reruns passed. Retain/quarantine these files in lockstep with the ledger rather than widening 5s/15s timeouts, adding retries, or changing worker budgets; the 2026-06-19 entries still delete on 2026-07-03 unless a real fixture-load invariant is found.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-21-09:58:
  FN-6839 rescues the retained bin, extension-task-tools, and extension suites by awaiting async TaskStore/cache shutdown before temp-root cleanup and proving the grouped/package lanes can run unexcluded. Keep the exclude list empty in lockstep with scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json; do not re-quarantine this loaded-lane signature without a new root-cause invariant.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-25-11:15:
  The SQLite-to-PostgreSQL cutover (feature quarantine-sqlite-internals-tests) quarantines the 'fn db' CLI command test (src/commands/__tests__/db.test.ts) which exercises the SQLite VACUUM dispatch via mockGetDatabase.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-25-14:00:
  The SQLite-to-PostgreSQL cutover (feature quarantine-sqlite-internals-tests, retry session)
  recorded pre-existing CLI test failures observed during verify:workspace. Root causes varied:
  - extension-fn-secret-get.test.ts: store.getAsyncLayer mock drift (async-satellite dual-path).
  - chat.test.ts: MessageStore.getInbox returns non-array under Node 26 node:sqlite (SQLite-path).
  - skill-sync.test.ts: undocumented engine tools (fn_acquire_repo_worktree, fn_artifact_*).
  - version.test.ts: changeset script assertion drift (project now uses scripts/release.mjs).
  - dashboard.test.ts: mesh lifecycle mock assertion drift.
  - bundled-plugin-freshness.test.ts: bundled plugin build freshness drift.
  The entries were quarantined on sight per AGENTS.md; FN-8219 deleted the five
  in-scope expired entries on 2026-07-17 rather than rescuing or re-recording them.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-07-17-09:45:
  FN-8210 restores package-config.test.ts to the package lane after the direct green run proved its failures were stale tsup plugin-external and verify:workspace expectations, not flaky behavior. Its old exclusion had no matching ledger entry; do not re-quarantine without new root-cause evidence and a lockstep ledger entry.

  FN-8219 reconciled the five 2026-06-25 config-only quarantines after their
  2026-07-09 deletion deadline. Per docs/testing.md, expired quarantines are
  deleted rather than rescued or re-recorded: extension-fn-secret-get
  (async-layer mock drift), skill-sync (undocumented engine tools), version
  (release-script assertion drift), dashboard (mesh lifecycle mock drift), and
  bundled-plugin-freshness (build freshness drift) are now git-history-only.
  The quarantine ledger has no packages/cli rows. FN-8223 now enforces full
  CLI config↔ledger lockstep, including package-config.test.ts if re-quarantined.

  SQLite-backed store (new TaskStore(..., {inMemoryDb: true}) / new Database(...)).
  The SQLite runtime code (Database class, inMemoryDb option, sync prepare()/

  flaky-test deletion ratchet, these tests are quarantined on sight (not migrated

  extension.test.ts failed in CI full-suite shard 3/4 with 'Target cannot be null or undefined' in the fn_delegate_task test and was quarantined under the deletion ratchet.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-06-27-10:05:
  FN-7119 re-ran extension.test.ts twice with the exclude removed and the fn_delegate_task null-target symptom no longer reproduces at HEAD. Keep this list empty so delegate-task validation coverage stays active in the package lane.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-07-16-06:27:
  FN-8093 rescues the isolated dist-barrel test before its deletion deadline. Its entire CPU-bound recompilation unit and fixture seeding run once in suite-scoped beforeAll, while each default-5s test body only executes an already-injected fn_task_list tool. The exclusion and matching ledger entry were removed in lockstep after loaded-lane verification; do not re-add either unless a new root cause is quarantined under the deletion ratchet.

  FNXC:CliTests 2026-07-18-07:30:
  FN-8271 rescued the shard-4 cascade after removing unrelated PostgreSQL template-copy and persistent-seeding work from extension-dist-barrel's built-dist hook. All fourteen affected CLI files return to the default lane with their matching quarantine-ledger rows removed; retain normal worker budgets and timeout defaults rather than reintroducing appeasement.


  FNXC:CliTests 2026-07-18-20:45:
  FN-8381 deletes extension-dist-barrel after its fourth quarantine cycle. Timing isolated the full core dist-barrel and re-mocked extension module graph as a 4–5.5s CPU-bound beforeAll while temp setup and cache seeding were negligible; shard contention pushed the same hook beyond Vitest's default 10s in run 29662476909. The source-side extension test retains the fn_task_list formatting/truncation invariant, while this test's marginal full-barrel substitution signal is not worth another load-sensitive rescue. Keep it out of both this exclusion and scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json; do not replace deletion with timeout, retry, or worker-budget appeasement.
