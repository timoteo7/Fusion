# Engine Session-Scoped Tools

This reference documents tools injected by the engine at runtime for specific agent session types. Some shared workflow tools are also part of the public extension surface; use `references/extension-tools.md` as the canonical user-invokable extension reference and this page for runtime agent-role availability.

- Source files: `packages/engine/src/agent-tools.ts`, `triage.ts`, `executor.ts`, `merger.ts`, `agent-heartbeat.ts`
- Availability: only when the engine creates a session for the matching agent role
- Runtime contract: engine sessions now forward requested skill names (`skillSelection.requestedSkillNames`) into the generic runtime `skills` field so non-pi runtimes can still receive Fusion skill intent.
- Important: do not tell users to call runtime-only tools directly from the generic extension tool list

## Shared runtime tools (`agent-tools.ts`)

| Tool | Agent Types | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fn_task_create` | triage, heartbeat | Create a follow-up task from within an agent run | `description` (string), `dependencies?` (string[]), `priority?` (`low` \| `normal` \| `high` \| `urgent`), `workflow_id?` (string) |
| `fn_task_log` | executor, heartbeat | Write significant task log entries | `message` (string), `outcome?` (string) |
| `fn_task_document_write` | triage, executor, heartbeat; chat/planning (explicit `task_id`) | Save/update a named **live-task** document revision, optionally with CAS; archived parents remain read-only | `key` (string), `content` (string), `author?` (string), `expected_revision?` (non-negative integer), `expected_content_hash?` (`sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`); chat/planning also require `task_id` (string) |
| `fn_task_document_read` | triage, executor, heartbeat; chat/planning (explicit `task_id`) | Read one named live or retained archived document; list mode remains live-only | `key?` (string); chat/planning also require `task_id` (string) |

For cross-task publication, read first and pass both returned values when practical: `{ "task_id": "FX-002", "key": "evidence", "content": "rebased evidence", "expected_revision": 3, "expected_content_hash": "sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" }`. Revision zero is create-if-absent. A stale write is an error result with `TASK_DOCUMENT_PRECONDITION_FAILED` and current revision/hash; re-read and explicitly rebase rather than retrying unchanged. Omitted expectations preserve unconditional compatibility.

Task archiving and archived-document publication are absent from every runtime tool schema. Agent tools may read a retained historical document only when an explicit key is supplied, while keyless list mode hides soft-deleted and historical parents.
| `fn_task_prompt_write` | plan/spec review (Plan Review reviewer) | Replace the task's authoritative PROMPT.md with revised plan/spec content during Plan Review/spec repair; routed through TaskStore so PROMPT.md validation and task.json sync stay the single persistence path. Provide the complete final PROMPT.md content; do not implement product code from plan review | `content` (string) |
| `fn_goal_list` | triage, executor, heartbeat | List goals with concise citation-ready snippets and active-goal warning details | `status?` (`active` \| `archived` \| `all`) |
| `fn_goal_show` | triage, executor, heartbeat | Show one goal's full detail on demand, including the full description body | `id` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_list` | executor | List the project's custom workflows (read-only built-ins plus user definitions) | none |
| `fn_workflow_get` | executor | Fetch one workflow definition by id — name, description, builtin flag, and the full IR (nodes/edges/columns/artifacts/fields/settings) as JSON | `workflow_id` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_select` | executor | Assign a custom workflow to a task (defaults to the current task) | `workflow_id` (string), `task_id?` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_create` | executor | Create a custom workflow definition from a graph IR (validated server-side). v2 IR supports step-inversion constructs: `parse-steps`, `foreach` (mode/isolation/concurrency/maxReworkCycles), `step-execute`, `step-review`, `code` nodes, `rework` edges, plus `artifacts`, custom `fields`, and typed `settings` declarations | `name` (string), `description?` (string), `ir` (object), `layout?` (object) |
| `fn_workflow_update` | executor | Update a custom workflow definition's name/description/ir/layout (built-ins cannot be edited; same step-inversion IR constructs as create; editing `fields` orphans rather than destroys existing task values; editing `settings` declarations drops orphaned setting values on resolution) | `workflow_id` (string), `name?` (string), `description?` (string), `ir?` (object), `layout?` (object), `rehome_to?` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_delete` | executor | Delete a custom workflow definition (built-ins cannot be deleted); selecting tasks are re-homed to the default workflow's entry column | `workflow_id` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_settings` | executor | Read/write a workflow's per-`(workflow, project)` setting **values** (`get` returns `{stored, effective, orphaned}`; `set` writes `values` and returns `{stored, effective, orphaned}`, with `null` clearing an override — including any stored value for an orphaned key). Validated against the named workflow's declared settings; built-in **values** are writable though built-in **declarations** are not; invalid values return a typed rejection list and persist nothing | `action` (`get` \| `set`), `workflow_id` (string), `values?` (object keyed by setting id) |
| `fn_workflow_list` | executor, chat, planning | List the project's custom workflows (read-only built-ins plus user definitions) | none |
| `fn_workflow_get` | executor, chat, planning | Fetch one workflow definition by id — name, description, builtin flag, and the full IR (nodes/edges/columns/artifacts/fields) as JSON | `workflow_id` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_validate` | executor, chat, planning | Dry-run validate a Fusion workflow IR without creating or mutating any workflow; runs the same server-side IR, trait, code-node, and column-agent validation as create/update and returns typed errors | `workflow_id?` (string), `ir?` (object) |
| `fn_workflow_select` | executor, chat, planning | Assign a custom workflow to a task (defaults to the current task) | `workflow_id` (string), `task_id?` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_create` | executor, chat, planning | Create a custom workflow definition from a graph IR (validated server-side). v2 IR supports step-inversion constructs: `parse-steps`, `foreach` (mode/isolation/concurrency/maxReworkCycles), `step-execute`, `step-review`, `code` nodes, `rework` edges, plus `artifacts` and custom `fields` declarations | `name` (string), `description?` (string), `ir` (object), `layout?` (object) |
| `fn_workflow_update` | executor, chat, planning | Update a custom workflow definition's name/description/ir/layout (built-ins cannot be edited; same step-inversion IR constructs as create; editing `fields` orphans rather than destroys existing task values) | `workflow_id` (string), `name?` (string), `description?` (string), `ir?` (object), `layout?` (object), `rehome_to?` (string) |
| `fn_workflow_delete` | executor, chat, planning | Delete a custom workflow definition (built-ins cannot be deleted); selecting tasks are re-homed to the default workflow's entry column | `workflow_id` (string) |

## Triage-only runtime tools (`triage.ts`)

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `fn_task_list` | List active tasks during specification (duplicate check, discovery) | none |
| `fn_task_search` | Keyword search over live tasks for duplicate detection | `query` (string), `limit?` (number), `includeDone?` (boolean) |
| `fn_task_show` | Fetch full task detail including PROMPT.md | `id` (string) |
| `fn_review_spec` | Spawn spec reviewer and return `APPROVE`/`REVISE`/`RETHINK`/`UNAVAILABLE` | none |

## Planning-only dependency tool (`triage.ts`)

Workspace tasks already contain every repository declared by `.fusion/workspace.json`; planners never select or acquire repositories on demand.

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `fn_install_worktree_dependencies` | Ask Fusion to run a planner-selected dependency install in a prepared worktree, or record a reasoned no-install resolution for unrecognised evidence. Only Fusion-observed exit code `0` records installed readiness. | `action` (`install` \| `none`), `command` (required for `install`), `reason` (required for `none`), `repository?` (required for multi-repository workspaces) |

## Executor-only runtime tools (`executor.ts`)

Note: step-session execution (`step-session-executor.ts`) reuses executor coordination tools (`fn_send_message`, `fn_read_messages`, `fn_list_agents`, task-document tools, and memory tools) so spawned/session-sliced execution keeps parity with main executor runs.

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `fn_task_update` | Update a spec step status (`pending`/`in-progress`/`done`/`skipped`), task dependencies (never a task it spawned), and/or workflow-defined custom field values | `step?` (number, 0-indexed; matches `### Step N:` in PROMPT.md, Step 0 = Preflight), `status?` (enum), `dependencies?` (string[]), `custom_fields?` (object keyed by field id; validated against the workflow field schema, `null` clears a field) |
| `fn_task_add_dep` | Add a dependency to current task (confirmation-gated; never a task it spawned) | `task_id` (string), `confirm?` (boolean) |
| `fn_task_done` | End the task: `outcome="completed"` (default) marks it complete; `outcome="blocked"` honestly parks it failed (`BLOCKED: <reason>`) with no completion claim, preserving steps/worktree and recording `blockedBy` as dependencies | `summary?` (string), `outcome?` (`completed` \| `blocked`), `blockedBy?` (string[]), `reason?` (string, required when blocked) |
| `fn_spawn_agent` | Spawn child agent in separate worktree | `name` (string), `role` (enum), `task` (string) |

## Merger-only runtime tools (`merger.ts`)

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `fn_report_build_failure` | Explicitly signal merge-time build verification failure | `message` (string) |

## Heartbeat-only runtime tools (`agent-heartbeat.ts`)

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `fn_heartbeat_done` | Signal end of heartbeat run with optional summary | `summary?` (string) |

## Workflow settings: declarations vs. values

Workflow settings split into two surfaces (the same split as custom task fields, one level up):

- **Declarations** (the typed schema) live in the workflow IR's `settings` array and are authored with `fn_workflow_create` / `fn_workflow_update`. Built-in workflow declarations cannot be edited (the store's built-in guard rejects the IR edit with a `WorkflowIrError`/built-in error surfaced through the tool result).
- **Values** (the per-`(workflow, project)` data) are read/written with `fn_workflow_settings`. Built-in workflow **values** are writable so each project can tune `builtin:coding` differently.

Declare a setting (custom workflow):

```jsonc
// fn_workflow_create
{
  "name": "QA",
  "ir": {
    "version": "v2",
    "name": "QA",
    "columns": [{ "id": "intake", "name": "Intake", "traits": [] }],
    "nodes": [],
    "edges": [],
    "settings": [
      { "id": "reviewHandoffPolicy", "name": "Review handoff", "type": "enum",
        "default": "disabled",
        "options": [
          { "value": "disabled", "label": "Disabled" },
          { "value": "always", "label": "Always" }
        ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Write a value (built-in workflow VALUE — accepted even though built-in declarations are read-only):

```jsonc
// fn_workflow_settings
{ "action": "set", "workflow_id": "builtin:coding",
  "values": { "workflowStepTimeoutMs": 600000, "reviewHandoffPolicy": "always" } }
```

An invalid value (e.g. an enum violation) is rejected with a typed list and persists nothing:

```jsonc
// returns isError:true with details.rejections:
// [{ "code": "enum-violation", "settingId": "reviewHandoffPolicy", "message": "..." }]
```

Read values — `effective` is what the engine actually consumes (declaration defaults filled in, orphaned values dropped); `stored` is the raw override map; `orphaned` lists stored entries with no current declaration (or a value that no longer validates). `set` returns the same `{stored, effective, orphaned}` shape:

```jsonc
// fn_workflow_settings
{ "action": "get", "workflow_id": "builtin:coding" }
// → { "workflowId": "builtin:coding",
//     "stored":    { "workflowStepTimeoutMs": 600000 },
//     "effective": { "workflowStepTimeoutMs": 600000, "reviewHandoffPolicy": "disabled", ... },
//     "orphaned":  [] }
```

Patching a key to `null` clears any stored value for it — including a value left behind under an orphaned key — so `set` doubles as the way to drop orphans. To see the full declaration catalog (every setting id, type, and default) call `fn_workflow_get` on `builtin:coding`, whose IR `settings` array is the canonical catalog.
