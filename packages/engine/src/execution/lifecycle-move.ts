    deferral. For the Code Review REVISE bounce (`performWorkflowRerunBounce`) the caller records a
    DURABLE capacity wait on this exact rejection, and the existing due-drain resumes the card when a
    slot frees. Before FUSI-068 the string was an unkept promise: the replay step was already durable,
    nothing retried after the watchdog's single 15s attempt, and the card was auto-disposed as a
    permanent deadlock. Callers other than the review bounce must not assume a retry exists — treat
    `deferred: "capacity"` as "nobody is coming unless this caller arranged it".
