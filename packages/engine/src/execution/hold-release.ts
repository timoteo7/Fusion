/**
 * Hold/release sweep — the generalized scheduler (U6, KTD-10, R3 behavior half).
 *
 * Flag-ON, the scheduler's poll becomes a *hold/release sweep*: for each
 * workflow in use by live tasks, it finds cards resting at `hold`-trait columns
 * and evaluates their release condition:
 *
 *   - `manual`         — released ONLY by an explicit {@link promoteHeldTask}
 *                        call (U9's promote endpoint / CLI). The sweep never
 *                        auto-releases a manual hold.
 *   - `external-event` — released ONLY by {@link releaseHeldTaskByEvent} (a
 *                        webhook/API release, same shape as manual + an event
 *                        tag).
 *   - `timer`          — released when the injected clock passes the hold's
 *                        deadline (`columnMovedAt + durationMs`, or an explicit
 *                        `deadlineAt`). Fake-timer friendly (FN-5048): the clock
 *                        is injected, never `Date.now()` baked in.
 *   - `capacity`       — released when a downstream capacity (`wip`) column has a
 *                        free slot (same counting rules as the in-txn check).
 *   - `dependency`     — released when the card's dependencies are satisfied
 *                        (KTD-5: dependency task's column has the `complete`
 *                        trait flag in ITS resolved workflow; FN-5719 dual-accept
 *                        also honors the legacy completion signal, logging an
 *                        audit-diff when the two disagree).
 *
 * Eligible cards move via `store.moveTask(..., { moveSource: "scheduler" })`.
 * A scheduler move bypasses trait guards (it is substrate-driven) but the in-txn
 * capacity check is NOT a guard — it still runs (KTD-10), so two holds racing
 * into one slot serialize: exactly one commits, the other rejects with
 * `capacity-exhausted` and retries next sweep.
 *
 * Reservation ordering (KTD-10): for releases into a processing (capacity)
 * column, the sweep reserves worktree + semaphore slots BEFORE issuing the move
 * and releases the reservation if the move rejects on capacity — a card is never
 * moved into a column it cannot actually start in, and a semaphore-exhausted
 * interleaving leaves the card held with no commit.

  path did not consult it.

  How it was reachable: the manual plan-approval gate parks the card by writing
  `status: "awaiting-approval"` with NO pause flag, so the pre-existing
  `task.paused || task.userPaused` skip in `runHoldReleaseSweep` did not match,
  and `isUnplannedForExecution` enumerates only `planning` / `needs-replan`. Once
  the plan-review gate's evidence landed, the sweep released a card whose plan the
  operator had never approved — the gate was skipped end to end.

  Checked HERE rather than in each caller because `issueRelease` is the single
  choke point every release surface funnels through (sweep, `promoteHeldTask`,
  `releaseHeldTaskByEvent`, and the scheduler's `reserveSlot` guard). Gated on
  `!options.allowUnplanned` for the same reason the unplanned check is: an
