FNXC:WorkspaceWorktree 2026-08-23-18:38:
`isReclaimableWorktreeCandidate` now requires Git to PROVE a candidate belongs to this project
before any destructive sweep touches it (a shared configured worktree root can hold another
project's checkouts). A bare `mkdir` under `.worktrees/` is therefore no longer reapable by
design, so the fixture builds a real linked worktree and then deletes only its ADMIN entry —
which is exactly what an unregistered orphan is: a proven-ours checkout that `git worktree list`
has forgotten. Both cases use it so the active-session deferral is proven against a path the
sweep would otherwise really remove, rather than one it declines for an unrelated reason.

    ("preserve worktree content during automatic cleanup", f082398be) made the reap a deliberately
    NON-RECURSIVE rmdirSync (packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts:16918) so the sweep can never destroy

    the checkout, so the removal branch is unreachable for a real orphan by design. The FN-5065
