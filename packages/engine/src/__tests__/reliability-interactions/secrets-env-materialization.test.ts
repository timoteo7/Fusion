  FN-9162 (3b0a6b795f) narrowed orphan reaping: a configured worktree root may be SHARED with other
  projects, so `isReclaimableWorktreeCandidate` now deletes only what Git proves belongs to this
  project's common directory. A bare directory with no `.git` at all is therefore protected, and the
  companion negative is pinned by worktree-pool.test.ts ("excludes containers and unproven
  half-initialized directories"). The secrets invariant this test owns is unchanged and still
  load-bearing: when a leaked worktree IS reaped, its env artifacts go with it. Ground it on the
  FN-6782 dangling-`.git`-pointer orphan — the leak form that remains reapable — rather than on the
  now-protected bare directory.

  FNXC:SecretsEnvMaterialization 2026-09-26-06:35:
  FN-3519 (f082398be) then made the dangling-`.git` orphan UNREAPABLE. It replaced the recursive
  `rmSync` in `reapOrphanWorktrees` with a non-recursive `rmdirSync` and stated the invariant
  explicitly: "No destructive reclamation of corrupt/dangling metadata when safety cannot be
  proven... prefer a recoverable disk leak over possible user-data loss." A dangling pointer means
  Git cannot enumerate the checkout's content, so that content is unverifiable — precisely what
  FN-3519 refuses to delete. The reap now only ever removes an EMPTY residue directory, and the
  companion negative ("preserves a dir with a dangling .git pointer") pins that.

  So the FN-6782 form this test was grounded on no longer reaches the removal call. The secrets
  invariant is still load-bearing, so this now pins the CURRENT contract: the reap must NOT
  destroy a leaked checkout it cannot prove is clean, and the leaked `.env` must survive with it.
  Losing the reap is a deliberate, reviewed trade — a disk leak over user-data loss — not a
  regression to fix in the product.
