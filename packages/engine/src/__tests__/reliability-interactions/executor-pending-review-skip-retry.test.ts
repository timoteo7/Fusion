Requirement unchanged: when the task's STEPS say the work is finished, implicit-done wins over the
pending-review skip heuristic, even if a stale review log line is still on the row.
What changed: the workflow graph now owns the run, and its `parse-steps` node RE-DERIVES the step
list from PROMPT.md on every run and writes every step back as `pending`. A step list marked `done`
on the fixture literal therefore no longer survives to the implicit-completion check — the only
thing that can leave a step `done` at that point is the implementation session itself doing the
work. Simulate exactly that: the session marks its steps complete but never calls fn_task_done,
which is the precise situation implicit-done exists to cover.
