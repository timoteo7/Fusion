/**
 * FN-4811 follow-up (FN-4819): the `reclaimSelfOwnedBranchConflicts` sweep must NOT
 * try to remove a worktree that is currently bound to a live executor/merger/step
 * session. Production failure shape on FN-4819:
 *
 *   1. Self-healing sweep runs, sees task.branch tip is already on main.
 *   2. Sweep calls `removeWorktree({ reason: SelfHealingBranchConflict })`.
 *   3. Active-session gate refuses (FN-4811): worktree is bound to FN-4819/executor.
 *   4. The thrown `ActiveSessionWorktreeRemovalError` is caught by the outer
 *      reclaim catch and escalated to `AutoRecoveryDispatcher` with class
 *      `branch-conflict-unrecoverable`.
 *   5. The dispatcher's decision.action === "pause" marks the task `failed + paused +
 *      pausedReason="branch-conflict-unrecoverable"`, even though the executor was
 *      actively making real progress.
 *
 * Fix: at the top of the per-task loop, skip tasks whose worktree is currently in
 * the activeSessionRegistry. The reclaim will retry on the next sweep when the
 * session is no longer holding the worktree.
