FNXC:WorkflowScheduling 2026-07-30-07:10 (E2E evidence — the optional-role-parameter class, third instance):

Third measured instance of the pattern from #2795 and #2798, and the sharpest form of it: the
converted and unconverted call sites are in the SAME FILE, and one is nested inside the other's call
tree.

`in-process-runtime.ts` resolves terminal columns through an optional parameter defaulting to the
legacy pair (`done` + `archived`). Three internal call sites:

  drainDuePlanningContinuations:386        passes { terminalColumns }              CONVERTED
  selectActionablePlanningContinuations:413 passes NOTHING                         unconverted
  resolvePlanningContinuationCandidate      threads its resolved set into the inner
                                            dispatchable predicate                 CONVERTED (2026-08-02)

WHAT BREAKS. `selectActionablePlanningContinuations` documents its own purpose as excluding
"soft-deleted / archived / done tasks so archive-fallback rows returned by getTask cannot re-enter
plan-review after the card left the board". On a renamed board its terminal check is against ids that
board does not have, so a card sitting in its COMPLETE column is classified `actionable` and re-enters
plan-review — precisely the thing the function exists to prevent, silently, on every custom board.

The third site WAS the subtler one — `resolvePlanningContinuationCandidate` applied the caller's
resolved set to its own terminal test and then delegated to `isPlanningContinuationTaskDispatchable`
without passing it. That half has since been fixed, and this suite is how it was noticed: the audit
case turned red on the arity change.

What did NOT change is the outcome. `selectActionablePlanningContinuations` still passes nothing, so
the CHARACTERIZATION case below is untouched — a card in a renamed COMPLETE lane still comes back
`actionable`. That is the useful shape of a partial conversion: the code reads more converted than
before and the operator-visible defect is exactly where it was.

WHY THE CENSUS CANNOT SEE ANY OF IT. There is no column literal at the unconverted call sites — the
literal is `LEGACY_TERMINAL_PAIR`, one function away, where it is correct for an unconverted caller
and correctly annotated. Same mechanism as #2795 and #2798; this file adds the intra-file variant.

SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY. The behavioural cases are driven end to end with real persisted rows from a
live PostgreSQL store and the real exported functions. The call-site split is asserted against the
runtime module's SYNTAX (parsed, not string-matched — see the note on that case) because driving the
drain needs the runtime's full dependency set, which I did not build; the audit case says so rather
than dressing it up.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-01:40 (follow-up — one severity correction and one site closed):

TWO REFINEMENTS to the above, both measured rather than argued.

1. `selectActionablePlanningContinuations` has NO PRODUCTION CALLER. Grepped across the repo excluding
   node_modules and dist: the only references are this file and
   `workflow-continuation-selection.test.ts`. The live drain is `drainDuePlanningContinuations:386`,
   which IS converted. So the stated consequence — a completed card re-entering plan-review "silently,
   on every custom board" — is NOT reachable today. The finding is real but LATENT: the helper is
   exported, so the first production caller inherits the bug. Worth keeping, worth not over-stating.

2. The THIRD site is closed. `resolvePlanningContinuationCandidate` now threads its own resolved
   `terminal` into `isPlanningContinuationTaskDispatchable`. Its reachable case is a board that declares
   `done` as a NON-terminal column id: the outer check passes, the inner one calls it terminal per the
   legacy pair, and the card is skipped as "paused" — stalled by a lane name. Pinned by two cases in
   `workflow-continuation-selection.test.ts`, revert-measured.

The first site is deliberately left: wiring a parameter into a function nothing calls would be an
unwired parameter, which is the anti-pattern the caller audit (#2803) removed five of.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never port 4040.

    AST, not string splitting. The first version found call sites by splitting on the callee name and
    then reasoning about the text that followed — whitespace, the next `;`, whether the slice started
    with a parameter name. A formatting-only change to the runtime could fail this suite or, worse,
    silently misclassify a site, which is the failure mode this whole series is about. Matching the
    repo's existing precedent for the same problem (`core/.../sync-workflow-ir-callsite-allowlist.test.ts`),
    the check now parses the module and inspects real call expressions and their argument lists, so
    it depends on the code's structure rather than its layout.

    An alarm in both directions, like #2798's: converting the remaining site fails this case, which
    is the moment to read the three behavioural cases above and update it deliberately.
