/*
FNXC:WorkflowExecutionOwnership 2026-07-28-09:10 (U8 / R3, R12 — workflow-owned lifecycle):

`handleGraphFailure`'s execution-policy ladder — the FN-7863/FN-7926 dispatch-loop gate, the
FN-7996 tool-failure retry, and the FN-7998 escalation — decided a task's own lifecycle by
naming `"todo"` and `"in-progress"` literally, at 8 sites. U5b converted the executor's
*rebounds* to `resolveReboundColumnFor` and these were left behind, each sitting somewhere an
awaited resolver could not reach: inside synchronous `updateTaskAtomic` mutators, inside
fire-and-forget resume closures, and in conditions evaluated before any resolution happened.

THE SEVERE ONE IS THE WIP GATE, and it is severe in the silent direction. `if (live.column !==
"in-progress")` classifies the run as "task already advanced — no further action needed". Under
a renamed implementation column that is true of a card sitting in its OWN wip column, so the
graph failure was swallowed whole: no terminal park, no status, no error, nothing on the board —
and the scheduler re-dispatched the same doomed run. Every downstream branch is behind that
gate, which is why the tool-failure retry, the escalation, and the bounded terminalization were
all unreachable rather than merely mistargeted. It is exactly the failure the program's problem
frame predicts: a guard that stops matching disables a recovery path invisibly and the suite
stays green.

Two further sites misbehave once the gate is passable:

  - FN-7998 escalation, node-target branch, wrote `column: "todo"` inside the atomic claim.
    Under a workflow with no `todo` column that parks the card where no workflow declares it —
    on the plan's "Stop implementation if" list, and what R7 exists to clean up after.
  - FN-7863/FN-7926's `live.column === "todo"` arm is the classic guard that stops matching.
    In-process the `executeNodeSelfRequeued` marker covers the same case, so a renamed workflow
    degrades only on the DURABLE arm — after a restart, or for a second TaskExecutor instance in
    the process, where the column read is the only evidence the inner executor requeued. A
    progressing card then falls through to the terminal sink and is parked `failed`.

Every test here was written against the literal implementation and observed FAILING first
(counts in the PR). The default-workflow and unresolvable-workflow cases are the regression
floor: `builtin:coding` resolves hold -> `todo` and wip -> `in-progress`, and an unresolvable
workflow keeps the legacy literals, so both must be byte-identical after the conversion.

Roles resolve per WORKFLOW, never per role: a resolvable IR uses `resolveLifecycleColumns` for
wip and KTD-10's `resolveReboundTarget` (hold -> intake -> first) for the requeue target, so it
can only ever be handed a column it declares. The legacy literals survive for exactly one case —
a workflow that cannot be read at all — which keeps pre-conversion behavior. See the
"never given a column it does not declare" block at the bottom for why the first cut's per-role
`?? "todo"` was wrong.

    Assert the DISPOSITION so this cannot pass on a silent return — but the disposition here is
    NOT a terminal park. An earlier classifier, the execution-resume router, owns this shape: a
    recoverable execute failure with incomplete steps is routed for resume, and the card is left
    in place because the router's own already-there check sees it. Asserting a failed park would
    encode the wrong contract; what this case pins is that the DISPATCH-LOOP gate did not claim
    it, and that the run reached a real classifier rather than falling off the end.

    Noted while writing this: the resume router's log said "moved back to todo" and its
    already-there check was another `"todo"` literal — one of the 20 sites in this method left to
    U5's executor slice. It is why the card USED TO stay put here rather than being rehomed to
    `inbox`.

    FNXC:WorkflowExecutionOwnership 2026-07-30-12:40:
    That literal is now converted, and this case flipped to the outcome the paragraph above
    predicted: the resume router rehomes the card to `inbox`, this workflow's declared intake column
    (`noHoldIr`), instead of leaving it parked in a `todo` the workflow does not declare. The
    prediction landing is the evidence the conversion is right, so this asserts the rehome rather
    than the absence of a move.
