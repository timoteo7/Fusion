/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-28-06:10 (Phase B / slice B3.1 — U4):

`recoverStrandedCompletedTodoTasks` promotes a card whose steps are all
done/skipped but which is still sitting in the HOLD column — work that finished
and never handed off to review. It decides "is this card in the hold column?"
TWICE, and both were literal:

  1. the QUERY — `listTasks({ column: "todo", slim: true })`
  2. the per-task GUARD — `task.column !== "todo"`

Both must convert together. Converting only the guard leaves a correct predicate
the sweep never reaches, because the query already returned an empty list;
converting only the query leaves the guard rejecting every row it just fetched.
Either half alone is a green diff with zero behavior change — the exact shape
that made B1's stale-paused-todo fix cosmetic.

TEST-HARNESS WARNING, load-bearing. The pre-existing `self-healing.test.ts` store
mock returns its fixture from `listTasks` REGARDLESS of arguments. A renamed-hold
test written on that harness passes while the query stays hardcoded, because the
mock hands the sweep rows the real store never would. The mock below therefore
HONORS `options.column`, and one test asserts the query is no longer scoped to
the literal. Do not "simplify" this mock.

    The card now declares `enabledWorkflowSteps: []`. The store double always reports a workflow
    selection, so when `getWorkflowDefinition` returns null the resolver SUBSTITUTES the default
    built-in coding IR rather than throwing — and that IR carries the default-on post-merge
    verification gate. `resolveNoOpFinalizeGateIds` (packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts:727) then
    reports a required gate with no passing result and the promoter declines, which is correct
    product behavior but says nothing about the legacy-column fallback this case exists to pin.
    The fallback itself is unchanged: `holdColumn` still defaults to "todo" on a resolver throw.
    This fixture owns no post-merge evidence gate, so it opts out explicitly rather than fabricating
    a gate result it never earned.
