FNXC:WorkflowRecoveryPolicy 2026-07-28-20:30 (U4 — pre-migration CHARACTERIZATION):

`surfaceStalePausedTodos` is about to become the first sweep retired onto the
recovery-policy reconciler. This file pins what it does TODAY, before the
migration, so the migration is judged against observed behavior rather than
against what the sweep looks like it should do.

Two questions, both of which the migration could silently get wrong:

  1. THRESHOLD SOURCE. The sweep reads `settings.stalePausedTodoThresholdMs`
     directly. Under the override layer an undeclared workflow must keep
     observing exactly that value — a migration that reaches for a declaration
     default instead would silently reset an operator who tuned it. This is the
     case the coordinator asked to see proven before anything else.

  2. USER-PAUSED CARDS. `getStalePausedTodoSignal` gates on `task.paused === true`
     and does NOT consult `userPaused`, so a user-paused card that has sat too
     long is surfaced today. The reconciler's ratified user-pause safeguard
     suppresses the `surface` action for `userPaused` cards, so routing this
     sweep through it as-is would STOP surfacing them. That is a behavior change,
     and this test is the evidence for it rather than an argument about it.

`paused` and `userPaused` are distinct fields that can diverge — see the comment
at `branch-group-ops.ts:128` about `userPaused` remaining true while legacy
`paused` is false — so the two cases below are genuinely separable states.

These are characterization tests: they pass against CURRENT main and must still
pass after the migration. If the migration changes either answer, that change is
deliberate and needs saying out loud.

Adding it is what keeps them load-bearing: left at the old arity every
`toHaveBeenCalledWith` here would fail, and every `.not.toHaveBeenCalledWith` would pass
vacuously — an assertion that can no longer fail is worse than one that is red.
