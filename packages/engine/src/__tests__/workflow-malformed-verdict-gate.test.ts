FNXC:WorkflowGates 2026-06-17-18:27:
FN-6582 requires malformed workflow-step verdicts to remain explicit failures for blocking gates while advisory gates may record a non-blocking advisory failure. These tests pin the shared imperative parser seam and the graph handler path so malformed output cannot be mistaken for APPROVE.

FNXC:ReviewLeniency 2026-07-02-00:30:
POLICY CHANGE (operator request): malformed gate output was treated as a NON-BLOCKING advisory, relaxing the FN-6582 hard block, and the malformed→block assertion was removed with it.

POLICY CHANGE REVERSED (operator request, 2026-08-26): a BLOCKING gate no longer approves on malformed output, and the assertion is restored below. The stated rule is that the only legitimate stop is an LLM problem; since `executeWorkflowStep` already retries a malformed response (fallback model, or a self-retry on the primary when none is configured), reaching this decision means the reviewer failed across every attempt — which is that LLM-class condition, and is never grounds to record approval. Advisory gates keep the relaxation, because a step that was never allowed to hold a card must not start holding one. The real mapping lives in runGraphCustomNode (`outcome: success || (!blocking && verdict !== "UNAVAILABLE") ? "success" : "failure"`).

  FN-6582's blocking-gate rule is RESTORED, and this is the test the relaxation deliberately removed.

  Operator decision, with the reason the first reversal lacked: "the only valid reason a task can be
  blocked is an LLM problem (429, 503); everything else is fixed at the source, or the AI is made
  unable to return anything other than what is expected — and if it does anyway, restart cleanly".

  Restarting cleanly already happens twice inside `executeWorkflowStep` (fallback-model retry, or a
  self-retry on the primary when no fallback is configured), so `malformed` reaching this decision
  means the reviewer failed across every attempt — exactly the LLM-class condition an operator accepts
  as a legitimate stop, and never a reason to record approval.

  Measured cost of the relaxation: a reviewer reported in prose that the deliverables were absent,
  carried no verdict JSON, and the gate recorded success — unreviewed work merged on a rejection
  nobody could see. A prose classifier cannot close this; that text held no rejection marker at all,
  because it was a factual statement of absence. Only the ABSENCE of a verdict is detectable.
