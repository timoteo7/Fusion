FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-19:10:
THE STARTUP STALE-PLANNING SWEEP, on a RENAMED board.

A card can carry `status: "planning"` while triage specifies it in place. A crash or restart before
planning completes leaves that status set, so a startup sweep clears it — otherwise the card occupies
a planning admission slot PERMANENTLY and new triage work never gets admitted.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The sweep's lane read was converted from `resolvePlannerLanes(store, "")` (an
empty task id, so it could only ever answer with the DEFAULT board) to a project-level
`resolveProjectColumnsForRoles(store, ["intake", "hold"])`. No test could observe that conversion:
neutering the resolver to an empty set left all 25 triage test files green (375/375).

THE SITE IS SEED-THEN-UNION, which changes what a blind means:

    const sweepColumns = [...new Set(["triage", "todo", ...projectPlannerColumns])];

Blinding the resolver to its legacy pair `["triage","todo"]` is a no-op FOR A DEFAULT BOARD — the
seed already contains both, so the union is unchanged. It is NOT a no-op for a renamed board, where
the resolver is the only contributor of `drafting`. Both blinds therefore fail the renamed cases
below, and the empty-set blind is the stricter one because it also models a resolver that returns
nothing at all.

(I predicted the legacy blind would be a no-op here and it was not. Recorded because the seed-then-
union caution is real but narrower than it first looks: it hides a defect only while every lane you
assert on is already in the seed. Assert on a lane that is not, and the union stops protecting it.)

WHAT BREAKS WITHOUT THE CONVERSION. On a board whose planner lane is `drafting`, the sweep queries
`{triage, todo}`, never lists the card, and never clears its stale `planning`. The slot is held
forever — the exact permanent-occupancy failure the sweep exists to prevent.

DIFFERENTIAL. Both vocabularies run the same workflow SHAPE with identical traits; only the ids
differ, and no renamed id collides with a legacy literal. The default-vocabulary run is the control:
it passes with or without the conversion (its lane is in the literal seed), so a generic break in
this path cannot hide here.
