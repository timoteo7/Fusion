FNXC:WorkspaceBoundary 2026-08-24-06:30:
Measured failure this guards, on a multi-repo project:

  Workflow node 'documentation-delivery-step' requires a task worktree — acquiring worktree
  [pre-merge] Workflow step failed: Documentation & Delivery
  Documentation & Delivery failed before producing a verdict:
    Refusing to start coding agent in incomplete worktree:
    .../multi-repo/.fusion/worktrees/mult-012
  Auto-recovered: session start refused unusable worktree — requeued to todo (attempt 1/3)

`mult-012` is the task DIRECTORY: a container whose per-repository worktrees (`mult-012/repo1`) hold
the Git metadata. The generic graph prompt path declared no session boundary, so the single-repo
assertion resolved that container as a worktree and refused. FN-158 gave Code Review the
`workspace-task-dir` boundary but not this path, so every OTHER write-capable gate stayed broken on
workspace projects — it simply went unnoticed because builtin:review-gated-coding died earlier on
the review seal.
