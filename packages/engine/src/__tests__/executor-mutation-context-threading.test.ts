/*
FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2 Stage C — the executor's run carrier, asserted directly):

`executor.ts` holds the repo's largest population of mutating store call sites and almost none of
them has an acting agent in scope, so U18 is satisfied here by a CARRIER (`currentRunContexts`, read
through the total `runContextFor`) rather than by an argument at each site. That makes the carrier
itself the thing worth testing: every other executor test asserts a specific behaviour and would
still pass if the carrier silently degraded to a marker or to `undefined`.

Three invariants, one per failure mode this stage could regress into:

  1. Inside a live run the store sees the RUN's actor — the assigned agent, not a lane label. A
     regression that dropped `currentRunContexts` and always returned the lane would pass every
     "was updateTask called" assertion in the suite and fail only here.
  2. Outside a live run the store sees the executor LANE, derived. Not `undefined` (which is what
     the partial `getRunContextFor` produced, type-checking only against U18's deprecated overload
     and attributing nothing) and not the unattributed marker (which would claim no actor is
     knowable for a write this lane demonstrably made).
  3. `getRunContextFor` stays PARTIAL. It is the liveness probe behind ~20 `?.runId` reads; if it
     were collapsed into the total form those probes would silently become unconditionally true.
