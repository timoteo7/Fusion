/*
FNXC:WorkflowExecutionOwnership 2026-07-29-16:40 (U8 / R4, R5, R12):

The exit announcement was wired into `createAuthoritativeWorkflowSeams.execute` — which is NOT
the handler production runs. `createDefaultNodeHandlers` picks the PRIMITIVES prompt-like handler
whenever `deps.primitives` is set, and `executeWorkflowGraph` always sets it, so the legacy-seams
prompt handler is unreachable for prompt nodes. Everything wired only there is dead code that
type-checks, passes its own unit tests against the seam object, and never runs.

That is why this file exists at all: a seam-level test cannot tell the two apart. These assert the
announcement on the LIVE primitive, and — more importantly — assert the wiring rule itself, so the
next person adding behavior to a seam finds out from a red test rather than from an operator.

The compat path for user-authored graphs, and the shape that proved the first version of it could
not fire. `graphFailureValue` reads only the LAST visited node's value; a custom graph may route
its generic `failure` edge THROUGH another node, whose value then becomes terminal. The
pending-review ending is still recorded in the run context, so that is where it is read from.

Without this the card falls to the terminal park — `status: failed` on work that was only WAITING
