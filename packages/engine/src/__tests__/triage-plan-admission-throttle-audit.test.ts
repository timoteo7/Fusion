FNXC:ConcurrencyAdmission 2026-07-26-09:30:
Regression suite for the diagnosability half of the FN-8600 incident.

Original symptom: an operator asked why a started card sat "Queued to plan" for seven minutes. The
answer was unrecoverable after the fact — the binding gate was written ONLY to `planLog.log`, which
lands in the TUI's in-memory pane (truncated) and is persisted nowhere. Reconstructing the timeline
required a manual DB forensics pass that still could not separate "host semaphore exhausted" from
"project cap consumed".

Invariant under test: whenever planning admission is withheld while eligible work exists, the
binding gate is recorded durably in run-audit with ids/counts only — and a sustained stall records
ONE row rather than one per poll, so the signal stays readable.

Drive the throttle through the PROJECT AGENT COUNT, not an exhausted host semaphore.

These cases previously spent a 1-slot `AgentSemaphore` to force the withhold. That
gate is deleted with the cross-project cap, so the poll no longer consults it and no
throttle event was emitted — the suite exercised a limiter that no longer exists and
would have gone quietly non-firing.

The REQUIREMENT is unchanged and is what these cases still pin: when planning
admission is withheld while eligible cards wait, the binding gate must be recorded
durably (FN-8600 — an operator asked why a card sat "Queued to plan" for seven
minutes and it was unanswerable after the fact). Only the gate that can bind has
changed, so the setup exhausts `maxConcurrent` instead.
