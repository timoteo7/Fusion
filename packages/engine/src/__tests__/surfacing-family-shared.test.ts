FNXC:WorkflowRecoveryPolicy 2026-07-27-23:45 (U4 — the surfacing family, SHARED test):

The three surfacing sweeps were three copies of one skeleton. They are now one
runner plus three specs, and this is the test that keeps them from drifting apart
again: every invariant below is asserted for ALL THREE via a table, so adding a
fourth surfacing sweep means adding a row, not remembering three separate files.

Written as a table deliberately. The drift this replaces was not a bug anyone
introduced on purpose — it was three places to remember, and the fix for one
(the at-most-once dedup, the fresh-row skip) silently not reaching the others.
