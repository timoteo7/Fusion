/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:40:
THE MERGE-REFUSAL REASON WAS CLASSIFIED BY A COLUMN ID.

`validateWorkflowDoneMergeProof` picks between two refusal reasons with
`task.column === "done"`. Both arms return `{ ok: false }`, so this never changed WHICH branch ran —
which is why an earlier audit recorded it as "diagnostic only" and declined it.

That undersold it. The reason is not a log line: it is written to run-audit metadata alongside
`previousColumn`, and that record is what an operator reads to find out why a merge was refused. On a
board whose complete lane is not called `done`, a card sitting in that lane was refused with the
generic `missing-merge-confirmation` — the classification for a card that is NOT in the complete lane
at all. The audit trail said the opposite of what happened.

Driven through `finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask` rather than by calling the validator with the new
argument, because the contract this pins is the WIRING: the caller already resolves
`isCompleteColumn` for its own guard one line earlier, and the defect was that it did not hand that
answer down. A test that passed the argument directly would assert my own parameter works and prove
nothing about the seam.

store-double-exempt: this file's subject is the merge REFUSAL. Every case here stops at the
`validateWorkflowDoneMergeProof` guard, so `moveTaskIf` and `updateTaskAtomic` are never reached —
modelling them here would assert a path the file exists to prove does not run.
