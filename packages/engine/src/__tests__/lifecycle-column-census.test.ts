FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-14:35 (Phase C convergence — the census's own tests):

A census nobody has tried to fool is a number, not a measurement. This pins every form the
lifecycle-column census must catch, and every form it must NOT count — because the tracked
`=== "triage"` grep it replaces was wrong in three separate ways, and each way cost real work:

  1. it counted only ONE of six legacy column ids (triage was under 4% of the total);
  2. it missed guards whose local was named `from` / `originColumn` rather than `column`;
  3. it counted `role === "triage"` / `agentType === "triage"` — AGENT ROLE comparisons that
     must never be converted, since the planner lane keeps that name.

Each case below is one of those, plus the comment-prose case that inflated two files' counts.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-17:12 (test wall-time — memoize identical full-repo census spawns):
The census CLI parses every tracked source file to a TypeScript AST on each invocation (~2s for ~1960
files). This suite spawned that identical read-only scan repeatedly — the `--json` census four times
and the plain report twice — all against the same repo state within one run, so their output is
deterministic and shareable. Memoizing a spawn's OUTPUT keyed by its exact argv collapses those
duplicate full-AST scans to one apiece WITHOUT changing any assertion: every test still reads the same
census result it read before, just from cache. This is the shared-harness discipline AGENTS.md's
"Do Not Add Slow Tests" rule asks for, applied to existing spawns, not test-timeout appeasement.
Only deterministic real-repo, default-env, no-baseline-override READS use this cache; baseline-mutating
(`--update-baseline`/`--strict` fixtures) and env-varying (`--claims` with a stubbed `gh`) spawns keep
their own process, since their output depends on inputs the argv cache cannot key on. These read-only
commands always exit 0 (they report, never gate), so a cache miss cannot swallow a nonzero exit.

`--update-baseline` MUST RUN EVEN WHEN A FILE ROSE. It could not: the rise check exited before the write,
so the only supported way to re-record was unavailable in exactly the situation that needs it.

That is a live problem, not a tidiness one, because #2654 gates CI on this AND A CONVERSION LEGITIMATELY
ADDS A LITERAL — the correct shape for a caller that may have no traits is
`flags ? flags.x : columnId === "legacy"`, and each one raises a file's count by one. Measured on main:
`columnRoles.ts` went 0 -> 1 from exactly that shape. So a worker doing the right thing met a red gate
whose only escape was hand-editing the JSON, which is how a ratchet becomes something people route around.

Exercised end to end before writing this, on a real rise injected into `live-agent-count.ts`:
  rise + plain --strict            exit 1  (unchanged — the ratchet still bites)
  rise + --strict --update-baseline exit 0, printing "ACCEPTED RISES  live-agent-count.ts: 6 -> 7"

  The order in CODE is unchanged and correct (`if (updateBaseline) {` at line 487, the rise message at

    FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-23:59 (the fixture rotted, and it took main red with it):
    These two cases pinned the FILE `self-healing.ts` and the NUMBER 1 — "stale baseline says 1, tree
    has more". Conversions took that file to exactly 1, so `toBeGreaterThan(1)` failed and `main` went
    red on a test whose subject (does `--update-baseline` write on a rise?) had not changed at all.

    Measured on a clean detached `origin/main`: 1 failed | 39 passed, with nothing from this branch
    applied. The backlog shrinking is the POINT of this program, so any fixture keyed to a specific
    file's count is guaranteed to expire — the only question is which cycle.

    So the target and the number are now DERIVED: ask the census which file currently holds guards,
    then construct a baseline one below that file's real count. The rise is manufactured rather than
    assumed, and the assertion is exact (`toBe(real)`) instead of an open inequality that was only ever

    not depend on how much work the fleet has finished.

    /*
    FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-20:40 (what `null` costs, recorded so a green run is not misread):
    Returns null when the census reports NO file with guards — the state the tree is in now that the
    backlog reached 0. The two cases below then assert `totals.column === 0` and return early, which is
    the honest thing to do: with nothing to inflate there is no rise to manufacture.

    But it means those two cases **stop exercising what their names say** at zero backlog. "exits 0 and
    REWRITES the baseline even when the count rose" and "exits 1 and LEAVES the baseline alone on a
    rise" are about the CLI's ordering and exit codes; at zero they assert the backlog is empty. If the
    write-before-exit ordering regressed — the exact bug those cases were written for — both would
    still pass.

    Worth stating because zero is not a state to wait out. It is the terminal state of this program, so
    the vacuity is permanent, and this file already legislates against exactly that ("Anti-vacuity: an
    empty exclusion list would make the assertion below trivially true").

    The durable fix is to stop deriving the fixture from production state — point the scan at a
    synthetic tree via a file-list override, the way `FUSION_CENSUS_BASELINE_PATH` already lets the
    baseline be faked. Recorded rather than done here: it needs a content-root correction in the CLI
    too (`triageFindings` and the sync-resolver check read via `join(REPO_ROOT, …)`, the SCRIPT's
    location, so an overridden list changes which paths are listed and not where they are read).

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-08-01-02-45 (coordinator item 2 — the ratchet must FOLLOW THE COUNT DOWN):

A DROP NOW TIGHTENS THE BASELINE INSTEAD OF FAILING. Failing hard was defensible in isolation — a stale
allowance is a hole, since those guards can return up to the old count while the check stays green. What it
missed is that the drop is almost never the author's to fix: eleven files dropped during one merge wave, none
of those PRs re-recorded, and none of their authors did anything wrong.

Measured three times since CI began gating this: `columnRoles.ts` 0 -> 1, then `executor.ts` twice. A
permanently-red gate is a bigger hole than a stale allowance, because it gets ignored and then nothing is
guarded at all. The RISE check — the actual purpose — is untouched and still fails hard.

Driven end to end through the real CLI with an isolated baseline (`FUSION_CENSUS_BASELINE`), because the exit
code and the file rewrite ARE the contract and no source-level assertion can prove them. All four transitions
were exercised by hand first:
  drop, --strict            exit 0, "TIGHTENED", baseline rewritten 9 -> 6
  drop, --strict --exact    exit 1, baseline untouched
  rise, --strict            exit 1

`hasDeferralNote` is what splits the backlog into "debt with a written reason" and "work nobody has
examined", and the census's default output now states a CONVERSION QUEUE EMPTY verdict from it. A
rule that only ever answers "deferred" would report the queue empty forever and silently stop the
fleet; a rule that only ever answers "unexamined" would send workers at sites whose owner wrote down
why they must not move (the #3108 -> #3114 -> #3126 sequence, three PRs). So it is pinned in BOTH
directions, and the window boundary is pinned exactly — 40 lines above the guard, not the guard's line.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-20:30 (u12 — the suite pinned the MATCHER, never the DISCOVERY):
Every test in this file feeds the classifier a source string, or drives the CLI against the real tree.
None asserts WHICH FILES REACH the classifier — so the scan could return an empty list and the whole
suite would still pass.

That is not hypothetical. `git ls-files` lists TRACKED files only, so a brand-new file with a plain
`task.column === "in-review"` scored 0 until it was staged (#3254), and the identical bug sat in the
move-target ratchet behind its own 12 matcher tests (#3256) — I wrote those tests specifically to stop
that gate regressing, and they could not see it, because they import the matcher and never run a scan.

`FUSION_CENSUS_FILE_ROOT` + `FUSION_CENSUS_FILE_LIST` drive a synthetic tree, so discovery is testable
without creating files inside a live checkout that the operator is writing to concurrently.
