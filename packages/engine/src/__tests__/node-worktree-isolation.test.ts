/*
FNXC:NodeWorktreeIsolation 2026-07-25-22:10 (no lane runs in the shared checkout — regression):
Operator requirement: Plan Review, Code Review, and every other node run in the TASK-SPECIFIC worktree;
the shared main checkout is for merge only. Before this, read-only graph gates fell back to
`this.rootDir` because a pre-execution task has no worktree yet. That is what let two tasks share one
path (the reported FN-1398/FN-1403 Plan Review session collision) and what let reviewers read a checkout
that other tasks and the operator mutate underneath them.

Invariant under test across the node surfaces that previously degraded to the root:
 - Plan Review (no worktree yet) acquires and runs in a task worktree;
 - a custom read-only gate (no worktree yet) does the same — this is not Plan-Review-special;
 - an existing usable worktree is REUSED, not re-acquired;
 - workspace Plan Review acquires every configured child checkout and runs from the task directory.
