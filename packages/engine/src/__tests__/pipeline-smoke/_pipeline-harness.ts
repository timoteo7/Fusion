  review-column workflow invalidates it one turn later: a Code Review REVISE appends remediation

  SETTLE AFTER A RESTART, NEVER SNAPSHOT IT.

  A restarted engine finalizes a merge-confirmed row through its own asynchronous startup recovery.
  Reading the row once, immediately, asks "has recovery finished?" at an arbitrary instant and treats
  "not yet" as "never" — which sends the caller down the `admitAndMerge` fallback. That fallback
  cannot succeed here BY CONSTRUCTION: staging deliberately replaced the row's step results with a
  single PENDING code-review row and its steps with a pending stale step, so merge admission is
  correctly refused and the scenario fails with "post-merge restart parked finalization".

  So the test's outcome depended on whether recovery beat a single read — passing in isolation (19/19
  across 8 runs) and failing intermittently under full-lane load, where the machine is busy. That is a
  property of how fast the suite happens to run, not of the product. `builtin:coding-ideas` is the
  variant that surfaced it because its extra in-review milestone lands the restart in the racy window
  more often.

  Same remedy and same shape as `settleActiveMerge` and FN-WF's earlier `driveToManualMergeHold` fix:
  a BOUNDED event-loop drain, not a wall-clock wait. It costs nothing when recovery has already
  finished, and it cannot mask a genuine hang — exhausting the budget still falls through to the
  fallback, which reports the real refusal.
