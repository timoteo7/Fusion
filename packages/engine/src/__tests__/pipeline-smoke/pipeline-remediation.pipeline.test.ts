FNXC:ReviewGatedRemediation 2026-08-25-03:10:
Proves the ONE behaviour a review-column workflow is bought for: a rejected Code Review returns the
card to implementation carrying NAMED work derived from the reviewer's findings, and that work is
actually executed and merged.

Why a dedicated file rather than extending S05: S05 asserts a different property (no merge without a
current approval) and gets there by racing the background auto-merge, which is what made it
intermittent under full-lane load. This drive is explicit and turn-by-turn — it never depends on when
a background merge happens to land — so it measures remediation instead of scheduling luck.

FNXC:ReviewGatedRemediation 2026-08-28-15:11:
The remediation checklist is also operator-visible execution history. A rejected review must leave every completed occurrence intact, append named fixes, and finish with a fresh verification occurrence that executes before the card can converge back through review and merge.
