/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-29-15:30 (P0 audit after the Planning-column merge):

The default coding lineage no longer declares a `triage` column — it has ONE pre-implementation
column, id `todo`. `triage` remains a legal column id (legacy coding, the Task enum), so nothing
throws; every `column === "triage"` comparison simply stops matching for default-workflow cards.
Silent non-firing guards are the failure class this program has now found seven times.

These pin the two sites in the executor's ownership that genuinely misbehaved. Both were observed
FAILING against the pre-fix code.
