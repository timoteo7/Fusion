FNXC:CodingIdeasV2Workflow 2026-08-24-05:35:
The ratchet FN-175 did not have. `execute-workflow-graph.ts` refuses any write-capable node once a
Code Review APPROVE exists (`workspace-review-seal-required`), because a passed review seals the
tree so nothing unreviewed reaches main. builtin:review-gated-coding routes code-review straight
into two write-capable nodes, so every task on it deadlocks the moment the review approves — and
nothing caught it, because its only coverage asserted graph shape by hand rather than running the
production classifier over the graph.

This test runs the REAL classifier over the real success chain. It fails if anyone ever moves a
write-capable gate after the review again.

  `verification` gate (classified write-capable only because the old predicate matched its display
  NAME), and `documentation-delivery`, which wrote repository docs. Verification is gone — Code
  Review runs the commands itself — and Documentation no longer touches the repository, so it may
  legally follow the review, which is the ordering its own author always intended.
