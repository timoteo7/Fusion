surface. This deliberately uses TypeScript AST nodes: textual scans cannot distinguish a call
from a comment or retain an enclosing closure when formatting changes.

The alias rule is deliberately narrow. A single-assignment local initialized from `store` or
`options.store` is a provable task-store alias; computed and destructured receivers fail closed
as suspects rather than being silently omitted from the frontier.
