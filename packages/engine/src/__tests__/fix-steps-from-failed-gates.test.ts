/*
FNXC:VerificationRemediation 2026-08-26-05:56:
The operator contract for the surviving Coding (Ideas) workflow, stated as behaviour a card shows:

  - A failing test INSIDE a step is the step's own problem. The executor fixes it there, and it must
    never become a separate fix step \u2014 otherwise every red test during implementation would litter
    the checklist with work the session is already doing.
  - A failing FINAL verification (the project's configured test/build commands, run once after every
    planned step succeeds) DOES become fix steps: the session that could have fixed it in place is
    over, so the work has to be visible on the card and re-dispatched.
  - A Code Review REVISE does the same, from the reviewer's findings.

These tests drive the REAL routing seam (`requestPreMergeOptionalStepFix`) and the REAL appender
against the REAL V2 workflow IR, and assert on `task.steps` \u2014 the list an operator reads on the card.
A spy on the appender would prove only that a function was called; the appender's `Verification`
branch was present, correct, and caller-less for days, which is exactly the failure a spy misses.
