/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-15:25 (batch-engine tail — the query-filter gap, made non-theoretical):

THIS TEST PINS A KNOWN DEFECT. It asserts what the engine does TODAY, which is the wrong thing, and it
exists so the defect stops being invisible. See
`docs/solutions/architecture-patterns/self-healing-sweeps-are-blind-on-a-renamed-board.md`.

THE DEFECT. `self-healing.ts` makes 49 calls of the shape
`this.store.listTasks({ column: "<literal>", … })`. `listTasks`' option is `column?: ColumnId` — ONE
literal column, applied as a filter in the store. On a workflow whose lanes are renamed, every one of
those queries returns an EMPTY array, so the sweep it feeds does nothing at all. The sweeps are not
mostly-correct-with-some-unconverted-guards; they never execute.

WHY THIS ASSERTS THE QUERY AND NOT THE OUTCOME. The outcome is the same either way (the sweep returns
0), so an outcome assertion cannot distinguish "did nothing because there was nothing to do" from "did
nothing because it asked the wrong question". The QUERY ARGUMENT is where the defect actually lives, and
it is observable without standing up the git evidence path these sweeps run once they have candidates.

WHY THE SUITE CANNOT SEE IT. Measured across `self-healing*.test.ts`: 30 files define a `listTasks` on
their store fake and 17 IGNORE the `column` option, returning every seeded task regardless of what the
sweep asked for. Those fakes are MORE PERMISSIVE than production, so the sweep under test receives rows
the real query would have filtered out. They prove the sweep's logic while saying nothing about whether
the sweep is ever reached — the mirror image of
`store-fake-defects-that-masquerade-as-production-bugs.md`.

WHEN THE QUERY LAYER IS FIXED this test will fail, because the sweeps will stop asking for the bare
legacy literal. That is the intent — it is a ratchet on a known gap, not an endorsement of it. Rewrite
the expectations against the new query shape at that point and delete this note.

The fix is NOT a literal conversion: `column?: ColumnId` takes one id, and resolution is circular at the
query layer (you need a task to know its workflow, and you are querying to find the tasks). It needs a
multi-column query option plus a resolved union across live workflows — a shared-store-API change across
49 call sites, which is a coordinator-level call.

  FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-21:40 (#2891 review P1 — the card the sweep disowned):
  `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` does not fail; it SUBSTITUTES the built-in IR. So a card whose workflow
  selection is missing or unreadable came back measured against `in-review`/`in-progress`, and the
  per-card verdicts then REJECTED the very card the project-scoped query had just admitted from a renamed
  lane. The sweep found it and immediately disowned it.

  The fix falls back to the PROJECT sets that admitted the card, so it is CLASSIFIED rather than dropped.
  This asserts that outcome rather than a log line — the observable is stronger and does not depend on
  wording.

  SUPERSEDED 2026-07-30 (#2891 review, second round): this asserted that the card IS classified, which
  was true of the project-union fallback I shipped first and is no longer the behaviour. Review pushed
  back that widening on an ACTION site — these verdicts clear a contamination pause — lets a column
  carrying a recovery role only in ANOTHER workflow admit this card. The union was replaced by
  skip-and-report: without the card's own board we do not decide, and the card is logged so it is
  visible rather than silently mis-decided in either direction.

  So the assertion is inverted rather than deleted. What it now pins is the same property from the
  other side — a renamed-lane card with no resolvable workflow must NOT be acted on — and it still
  fails if someone restores either earlier answer, because both of those classify it.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-21:40 (#2867 review — greptile, "hard-blocker wiring remains
untested"):

THE WIRING, TESTED AT THE SEAM RATHER THAN THROUGH THE SWEEP.

`recoverAlreadyMergedReviewTasks` calls `getTaskHardMergeBlocker(..., { reviewColumns: await
ownReviewLanesForAlreadyMerged(task) })`. The sweep test above stops at candidacy, and the note there
defended the gap as "type-checked and identical to a shape proven elsewhere". Type-checking cannot see
it: `reviewColumns` is an OPTIONAL property on an options object, so omitting it compiles. The
inert-seam gate cannot see it either — it tracks trailing optional PARAMETERS, not options-bag
properties. Nothing was watching the argument from either direction.

Driving the sweep to that line needs `resolveSelfHealingMergeTarget` and `findAlreadyMergedTaskCommit`
to succeed, i.e. a real git repo, which would make this a git fixture rather than a lane test. So the
seam is asserted directly: with the card's resolved lanes supplied there is no blocker, and without
them the same card blocks — reproducing the production symptom exactly, an already-merged card on a
renamed board failed with "Merge confirmed but finalization blocked", the sweep's purpose inverted.

WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT COVER, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. I deleted the `reviewColumns` argument
from the sweep's call site and these three cases stayed GREEN. They pin the SEAM's behaviour, not the
producer that fills it — the same guard-versus-resolver split that made the planner-metrics option
inert in #2842, where only a test driving the PRODUCER caught the omission.

So this is an improvement over the claim it replaces ("type-checked and identical to a shape proven
elsewhere", which was unfounded — an optional options-bag property compiles when omitted and the
inert-seam gate does not track those), but it is not coverage of the wiring. Covering that needs a
test that drives `recoverAlreadyMergedReviewTasks` far enough to reach the call, which needs
`resolveSelfHealingMergeTarget` and `findAlreadyMergedTaskCommit` to succeed against a real repo.
Stated here so the next reader does not mistake three green cases for a watched argument.
