THE INVARIANT: a corrupt census baseline fails with a DIAGNOSIS, and `--update-baseline` refuses to
regenerate on top of one.

MEASURED CAUSE, TWICE IN ONE PROGRAM — including once by me after I had already documented it. A
rebase or cherry-pick leaves CONFLICT MARKERS in the derived baseline; the operator runs
`--update-baseline` to fix it; the strict comparison's `JSON.parse` throws FIRST, the run dies before
writing anything, and the still-conflicted file gets staged. CI then fails with a raw `SyntaxError`
naming a byte offset and nothing about what to do — I lost two rounds to exactly that.

Both halves are covered here because fixing only the message would have left the trap intact: the
`--update-baseline` path is the one an operator reaches for, and it was the path that silently did
nothing.

This is a guard on the guard. `--strict` is the lifecycle ratchet the whole program leans on; a
failure mode that turns it into an unreadable stack trace is worth pinning, since the response to an
inscrutable ratchet failure is to disable it.

    ASSERTS A HEALTHY OUTCOME, NOT PERMANENT EXACT SYNC.

    This required "every file matches its baseline exactly", which demands the COMMITTED baseline be
    byte-in-step with the tree at all times. It is not: a conversion that removes guards leaves the
    tree holding FEWER than the baseline allows, and the CLI treats that as the good case — it
    tightens the pin and exits 0. So every legitimate conversion that did not also re-record turned
    this test red on main (measured: four separate main reds in one day).

    This guard's job is narrower — prove the CORRUPTION diagnosis does not fire on a healthy file —
    and a tightened baseline IS healthy. It therefore asserts a zero exit (execFileSync throws
    otherwise, so a RISE still fails: real debt stays loud), no corruption diagnosis, and one of the
    two healthy outcome shapes.

    A rise, a corrupt file, and an unreadable file all still fail. Only "converted guards, pin not
    re-recorded yet" stops being red, which was never a defect.
