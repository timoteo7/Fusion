FNXC:MissingWorktreeRetry 2026-07-31-06:10 (PR #2728 review — greptile):
The classifier hardcoded `in-review`, so on a renamed board a card stranded by an unusable-worktree
session start was not recognised as retryable — while every guard AROUND it had already been
converted. A disagreement between neighbouring checks is harder to diagnose than the original inert
literal, because each one individually looks right.

`reviewColumns` is optional and defaults to the legacy id, so the three existing call sites are
unchanged until each passes its own resolved set.
*/
/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-11:20 (fleet: restart-recovery roles):
`reviewColumns` is REQUIRED now. It was optional with a `task.column === "in-review"` fallback that
production never took — `self-healing.ts` supplies the resolved set at every call site — so the
literal survived only because these tests omitted the argument. Passing the set preserves exactly
what each case asserts while removing the last thing keeping the fallback alive.

Worth recording: making the parameter required produced ZERO tsc errors, because the engine
tsconfig covers `src` and not `__tests__`. A clean typecheck was not evidence here; only running
the tests found these call sites.

  The second parameter is the caller's already-RESOLVED answer, not a lane set. Both PRs widened this
  function and each typechecked on its own branch; whichever merged second would have overwritten the
  other's signature and broken its call site without git flagging a conflict. This file now matches
  #2736 exactly, so the second merge is a no-op here.

  Recording why these cases were rewritten rather than left: they were written against the SET form,
  so after the switch `["signoff"]` was simply a truthy value and two of them passed for the wrong
  reason. Engine tsconfig excludes `src/__tests__`, so tsc could not see the mismatch — only reading
  them could.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-23:20:

THE INVARIANT: restart recovery sweeps the board's OWN wip lane.

THE FLAGGED QUERY, NOW CONVERTED. The note this replaces was correct that the `listTasks({ column })`
QUERY was the live filter and the `.filter` beneath it a redundant re-assertion — so converting the
predicate alone would have dropped a census count and changed nothing, because the board's wip rows
were never listed. On a renamed board this recovery did not run at all: an engine restart left
interrupted tasks stuck with no requeue.

THREE LAYERS, and naming them is the point, because the previous two conversions in this class each
hid a second one behind the first:

  1. the QUERY — fixed here, project-level (`resolveProjectColumnsForRoles`), since no task is in hand
     before the read;
  2. the redundant `.filter` — DELETED rather than converted; re-asserting the column the query just
     selected on adds nothing, and a second copy of a rule is how a read and its filter drift;
  3. the move DESTINATION — already resolved via `resolveReboundTargetForTask`; only its comment was
     stale, still describing the pre-fix state, and is corrected in place.

REVERT PROOF, measured: restore `listTasks({ column: "in-progress" })` and the renamed case requeues
nothing.
