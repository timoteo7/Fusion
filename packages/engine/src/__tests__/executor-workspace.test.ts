FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-21-12:00:
U1 executor session-scoping tests. REWRITTEN from the foundation's self-mocking version (which vi.mock'd the very functions under test and proved nothing). These tests use a REAL two-repo git fixture (`createWorkspaceFixture`) under a NON-git workspace root, so a leaked rootDir git preflight would actually fail. They drive the real TaskExecutor methods that U1 changed: the activeWorktrees Set conversion + every enumerated consumer (KTD2), the preflight gate + browse-only-root scoping (KTD1), and the synthetic-acquisition cwd.

Seam choice (FN-5048): `(executor as any).workspaceConfig` is set directly to drive the gating with real git — loadWorkspaceConfig is covered by its own unit and is not the subject here. No mock-the-world child_process/fs shell.

  FNXC:NodeWorktreeIsolation 2026-07-29-18:20 (U9 re-green; consequence of PR #2531):
  These two cases used to assert that `clearPhantomExecutorBinding` SUCCEEDS while
  session-registry paths are held, and swept (or preserved) them. FN-6756 inverted
  that: `hasLiveSessionSurface` now includes
  `activeSessionRegistry.pathsForTask(taskId).length > 0`, and that guard runs
  BEFORE both branches — so any registered path refuses the clear outright. The old
  expectations describe the pre-#2531 contract.

  Rewritten to assert the CURRENT contract, which is the P0 fix's actual promise and
  had no direct coverage: a registered surface of any kind means someone is working
  in that worktree, so the reclaim refuses rather than reaping it.

  ⚠️ FLAG FOR THE #2531 OWNER — not fixed here, because it is a product decision:
  the guard appears to make BOTH of the branches it precedes unreachable for their
  stated purpose.
    - the default branch exists to unregister every held registry path (FN-6736);
    - `preserveWorktrees: true` exists to KEEP those registry paths so a
      `moveTask(preserveWorktree:true)` re-dispatch reattaches to the same worktree
      (FN-7249), and its ONLY production caller is the self-healing reclaim at
      self-healing.ts:3565.
  Both require registered paths to do anything, and the guard rejects exactly that
  case. With no registered paths, one sweeps nothing and the other preserves
  nothing. The third case below pins this so the conflict is executable rather than
  prose. Resolving it — e.g. exempting the non-destructive `preserveWorktrees` path,
  or narrowing the guard by kind — belongs to whoever owns FN-6756.
