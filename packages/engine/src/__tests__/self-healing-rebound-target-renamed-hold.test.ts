/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:59:
THE REBOUND TARGET, not the guard that selects the card.

`self-healing.ts` held 18 `moveTask(task.id, "todo", …)` calls — every one a RECOVERY. A move target
is an ARGUMENT, not a comparison, so the lifecycle-column census never counted them and no gate ever
pointed here. The failure mode is also harder than a guard's: `moveTaskInternal` REJECTS a target the
workflow does not declare (`TransitionRejectionError: unknown-column`, documented in
`task-store/moves.ts`). So on a renamed board these sweeps did not degrade to "no rescue" — they threw,
and the strand each sweep exists to clear survived while the sweep reported failure.

`reconcileInReviewUnmetDependencies` is driven here as the representative: it is a public entry point
with a documented contract (FN-6793), and its rebound is one of the 18.

WHY THE DEFAULT-BOARD CASE IS THE CONTROL AND NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. `resolveReboundTargetForTask`
degrades to `"todo"` whenever the workflow declares no hold/intake lane, so the conversion is a no-op
on every board we ship. The control pins that; without it a regression that made the resolver always
answer `"todo"` would leave the renamed case failing and look like a fixture problem.
