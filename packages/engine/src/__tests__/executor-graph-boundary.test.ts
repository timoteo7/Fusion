FNXC:WorkflowMerge 2026-07-19-05:20:
U5a scenario 1 — the workflow merge boundary lands the card in the merge NODE's
OWN IR column, not a hardcoded "in-review":
  - builtin:coding places its merge-class nodes in `in-review` → the default
    pipeline lands in `in-review` (KTD-7 parity), byte-identical to before.
  - a user-authored workflow (the benchmark) places the merge node in `Merging`
    → the card lands in `Merging` because the IR says so.
These call the executor's merge-boundary resolution directly (via `as any`) so the
assertion does not depend on the full agent-session execute() path.

FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2):
These call-arg assertions now include the mutation context the converted sweep passes.
Adding it is what keeps them load-bearing: left at the old arity every
`toHaveBeenCalledWith` here would fail, and every `.not.toHaveBeenCalledWith` would pass
vacuously — an assertion that can no longer fail is worse than one that is red.
