/*
FNXC:WorkspaceReviewScope 2026-08-26-09:12:
A workspace Code Review runs the review step ONCE PER SUB-REPOSITORY, against that repository's own
worktree. The scope block it shows the reviewer was captured with the SINGULAR `task.baseCommitSha`,
which does not resolve inside a sub-repository, so the capture returned nothing and the prompt said
"(no modified files detected for this task)".

Measured on a real multi-repo card whose executor had COMMITTED in both repositories: the reviewer
went looking, could not see the committed fixtures inside its own scope, and reported them as never
delivered. A confident, factual rejection produced entirely by a wrong diff base — and one that then
vanished, because prose with no verdict JSON is classified malformed and passes a blocking gate.

This pins the base each reviewer receives. The per-repo value was already recorded and already used
by the evidence capture in `workspace-review-per-repo.ts`; it simply never reached the reviewer.
