/*
FNXC:WorkflowMergeFinalization 2026-07-28-11:40 (E2E — closing merge-family ledger entries):

WHAT THIS CLOSES. The unproven-sites ledger in workflow-lifecycle-live-e2e says the
merge/rebound family "needs a REAL git worktree, branch, and squash … an engine-slow
real-git lane, not another table row". That is true of the MERGER, but it turned out
to be too broad: `finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask` is the step that actually moves a
proven-merged card to the workflow's COMPLETE column, it takes a real `TaskStore`,
and it needs no git at all — the merge proof is a field on the row. So three ledger
entries are reachable today without building that lane:

    auto-merge-finalization.ts  resolveCompleteColumn        -> the card's destination
    auto-merge-finalization.ts  resolveMergeOrchestrationColumn -> the pre-complete lane
    auto-merge-finalization.ts  columnHasFlag(ir, col, "complete") -> the already-done classifier

WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN ITS SIZE. This is the last move a card makes. If
`resolveCompleteColumn` silently returned the literal `done` for a workflow whose
complete column is `shipped`, a proven-merged card would be moved to a column its
own workflow does not declare — or refused and left stranded in review with the work
already landed. That is the most expensive failure shape in the lifecycle, and until
now nothing had run it against a renamed workflow.

SUBSTITUTION BOUNDARY. Only the merge PROOF is seeded (`mergeConfirmed`), which is
what a real merger would have written. Everything downstream — column resolution,
the move, its guards, persistence — is real, and every assertion reads the persisted
row back through `getTask`.

store-double-exempt: this file drives the REAL `TaskStore` through the shared PostgreSQL
harness (`createSharedPgTaskStoreTestHarness`). There is no double here, so the real
`moveTaskIf` predicate fencing and real `updateTaskAtomic` reducer are what run — which is
the point: a double could only re-assert this file's own fixture.
