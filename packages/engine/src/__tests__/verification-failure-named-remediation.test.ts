/*
FNXC:VerificationRemediation 2026-08-26-04:58:
The FN-3345 deterministic verification gate runs `testCommand`/`buildCommand` after every planned
step succeeds and BEFORE the in-review handoff. When it goes red, the executor must receive NAMED
work to do. These tests pin which bounce shape each `stepReopenPolicy` gets, because the two are not
interchangeable and picking the wrong one silently discards the measurement:

  - `reopen-trailing` is retained by builtin:coding and by the composition-base IR asserted below.
  - `none` (builtin:coding-ideas) forbids reopening, so remediation must ARRIVE as appended steps.

The defect: `none` reached `sendTaskBackForFix` all the same, which reopens nothing under that
policy. The card bounced to implementation with zero pending steps, the foreach answered
`already-expanded`, and it walked on to Code Review with the failing command unaddressed.
