FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-22:20:

THE INVARIANT: the stale-task sweep reads the board's OWN wip and review lanes.

THE QUERY, NOT A COMPARISON — and this file's census count is **ZERO**. It contains no lifecycle
comparison at all, so it has never appeared in the backlog, in any per-file list, or in any "N → 0"
claim. It was nonetheless completely inert on a custom board: `listTasks({ column })` filters in the
store, both reads returned empty, and the reporter surfaced nothing — on exactly the board where work
is most likely to be sitting unnoticed.

Second demonstration of the class after `backlog-pressure-reporter`, and the pattern is deliberately
identical: resolve the roles, iterate the set, dedupe by id. #2800 measured 49 more of these in
`self-healing.ts` alone.

REVERT PROOF, measured: restore `listTasks({ column: "in-progress" })` and the renamed case surfaces
zero stale tasks instead of one.

  /*
  FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-18:14 (found by BLINDING — the review half was uncovered):
  This describe already declared `signoff` in its IR and no case ever put a card there, so the
  REVIEW resolver was doing nothing any test could see. Measured with the #3214 procedure against
  this file's 7 cases:

      wipColumns    -> ["in-progress"]    1 failed   covered
      reviewColumns -> ["in-review"]      0 failed   UNCOVERED

  Rule 1 in that doc is exactly this: coverage is PER-RESOLVER, not per-sweep. Both resolvers sit in
  one `Promise.all` and read as a single converted sweep; only one of them was held by anything.

  WHAT IT COSTS: `reviewColumns` decides which rows the staleness read even FETCHES. Against the
  literal, a card parked in a renamed review lane is never queried, so a review that has silently
  stalled for days is never surfaced — the precise condition this reporter exists to report.

  The card must be stale by the IN-REVIEW thresholds, which the harness above already supplies; a
  fixture leaning on the in-progress ones would surface through the wip path and prove nothing.

    signal then correctly REFUSES it, because that card's own workflow does not call `in-progress` a
    wip lane. The product was right and my premise was wrong.

    What the union actually buys is that the row is FETCHED at all; whether it is stale is then the
    per-task question. So the honest legacy case is a store with no workflow selection, where both
    halves fall back together — which is the compatibility guarantee that actually matters.
