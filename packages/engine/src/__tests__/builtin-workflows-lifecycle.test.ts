FNXC:WorkflowBuiltins 2026-07-19-11:30:
Lifecycle acceptance for EVERY built-in workflow under the IR-driven runtime.

The U11 benchmark proves ONE operator-authored graph walks its own columns. This
file proves the same contract for the graphs we ship, because the cutover made a
node's `column` the card's real lifecycle position: a built-in that mis-columns a
node no longer merely looks wrong on the board, it moves the card. That is not
hypothetical — this suite found `builtin:review-heavy` bouncing a card
in-review -> todo -> in-review at its `security` gate and `builtin:design` doing
in-progress -> todo at `design-review`, both because unseamed linear-spec nodes
defaulted to the capacity-hold column (fixed in builtin-workflows.ts).

Per built-in it asserts:
 (1) the IR parses under U2's hardened rules and every node names a declared
     column; the creation column resolves; a merge-blocker column has a
     reachable merge-class node (parse enforces, we assert the shape);
 (2) a lifecycle smoke drives a card through the workflow's OWN column trail —
     ordered, contiguous, never a column the workflow does not declare, and the
     hold->wip seam crossed only by the scheduler (KTD-2);
 (3) failure parks the card IN PLACE (KTD-1);
 (4) review gates record graph-authored, lease-stamped step results.

The harness is modeled on benchmark-six-column-workflow.test.ts: injected
primitives, a real `createWorkflowColumnBoundary`, and a wrapper that plays the
scheduler when the boundary refuses a hold->wip move.
