FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-08-01-19:50 (fleet: project-engine.ts merge lane):

THE INVARIANT: the merge machinery recognises the task's OWN merge lane.

Every merge guard in `project-engine.ts` spelled it `in-review`. The consequence on a renamed board is
not an error anywhere — it is auto-merge DECLINING every card:

  - `requestInterpreterMerge` returns `noOp: true` ("parked cleanly in review, awaiting human merge")
    for a card that was in review and fully eligible;
  - the merge-queue snapshot returns an EMPTY list for a queue full of review cards, so the
    coordinator sees nothing to admit;
  - the taskMoved handoff never fires, so nothing is handed to auto-merge in the first place.

That is why this class has no error signature to search for: the operator sees cards resting in review
with auto-merge on, and every log line says the system did the right thing.

HOW THIS DRIVES THE REAL METHOD. `ProjectEngine`'s constructor builds a whole runtime, which a unit
test has no business standing up — so the method is invoked with `.call()` on a minimal `this`
providing exactly what it touches: `runtime.getTaskStore()`, `allowInReviewMergeProcessing`, and
`onMerge`. The body under test is the shipped one, not a copy. `onMerge` is stubbed because reaching it
IS the assertion: eligible routes to the serialized merge path, ineligible returns the `noOp` result.

REVERT PROOF, measured: restore the literal and the renamed-board case returns `noOp: true` instead of
routing to `onMerge`.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-08-01-22:10 (PR #2706 review — greptile P2, and the project's own
Surface Enumeration rule says the same thing):

The first block covered `requestInterpreterMerge` only, while the change also touches the merge-queue
snapshot, the queue drain, the `taskMoved` handoff, the pause-interruption tracker and the
session-advisor WIP guard. A suite that covers one of six surfaces can stay green while renamed-board
cards disappear from admission or pause tracking again.

Two more surfaces are covered here, chosen because they are the ones with STATE an assertion can see:

  - THE PAUSE-INTERRUPTION TRACKER, because it has state an assertion can see. On a renamed board its
    first branch DELETED every card from `pausedReviewTaskIds` and returned, so pausing an active merge
    never interrupted it.

NOT COVERED, and named rather than implied — I tried each of these before dropping it:

  - THE MERGE-QUEUE SNAPSHOT. Its failure is the quietest in the file (an EMPTY array for a queue full of
    review cards, with no log line saying why), so it is the one I most wanted. The admission provider is
    registered in the CONSTRUCTOR, which builds a whole runtime, so reaching its `refresh` needs a booted
    ProjectEngine. My first attempt looked the method up dynamically on the prototype and would have
    silently skipped — a case that cannot fail is worse than an absent one, so it is gone.
  - THE `taskMoved` HANDOFF and THE QUEUE DRAIN schedule real timers and recurse into the merge machinery.
  - THE SESSION-ADVISOR guard needs a live advisor.

Those four are covered by the census and by review only. Padding the suite with cases that assert nothing
would make the gap invisible, which is the failure this file already documents twice.
