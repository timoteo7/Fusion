U10 (R9) TOMBSTONES — "the old world is gone and provably stays gone".

The IR-driven lifecycle cutover deleted the machinery that existed only for the period when the
workflow graph was NOT yet the sole authority over task lifecycle. Deleting it once is not enough:
each of these symbols was load-bearing for years, so a well-meaning re-introduction reads as a fix
rather than a regression. This test is the ratchet.

Two assertion shapes, deliberately cheap (grep-level, no engine boot — FN-5048: do not add slow
tests):
  1. FILES that must not come back.
  2. SYMBOLS that must not appear in EXECUTABLE source. Comments are stripped first: every deletion
     above left an explanatory FNXC tombstone naming the thing it removed, and those notes are the
     point — they must survive while the code must not.

Scope is production source only (`packages/<pkg>/src`, excluding `__tests__`). Test files may still
name a deleted symbol while asserting its absence, and docs/plans record the history.

  cannot tell an index conflict from a transient database error, so it destroys legitimate holds;

  and it leaves a window with zero active rows, which strands the task silently. The repository
  already has the correct primitive — `replaceActiveTaskWorkflowContinuation` retires
