  greptile caught that the chokepoint fix was INCOMPLETE. Adding a refusal to
  `clearPhantomExecutorBinding` only protects callers that HONOR the return value.
  `recoverPausedAbortFailures` discarded it, so a live planner was still losing its
  worktree through pause-abort recovery — and that path moves the card to `todo`
  BEFORE releasing ownership, so the executor-only gate let it be requeued too.

  This is the same failure that produced the original bug: FN-8600 was fixed at the
  reclaim sweep and never enumerated to the leaked-slot reaper; the leaked-slot
  reaper was then fixed and not enumerated to pause-abort. Hence a test per caller,
  not per report.

  A refused release must not merely fail to clear — it must not NARRATE success.

  The original defect had two halves and the second is why nobody caught it from
  logs: after ignoring the refusal, the path still wrote "Auto-recovered: pause-abort
  park cleared", emitted `task:auto-recover-paused-abort-park`, and incremented the
  recovered counter. An operator reading the task log saw a clean recovery at the
  exact moment their planner lost its worktree.

  This drives the refusal through the executor's REAL guard (not a stubbed boolean),
  with the registry pre-gate deliberately bypassed — the task has no registered path,
  but an executor session surface is live. That is the defense-in-depth branch, and
  it asserts the full no-op: no un-park, no move, no log, no audit, no count.
