FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-18:55:
THE DELETED-BLOCKER SWEEP, on a RENAMED board.

When a task is soft-deleted, a `task:deleted` listener reconciles every dependent that was blocked by
it: the dependent's `blockedBy` is cleared so it can be scheduled again. It reads two lanes to find
those dependents — the hold lane and the WIP lane.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The WIP read (`resolveProjectColumnsForRoles(store, ["countsTowardWip"])`) was
converted to traits, but NO test could observe the conversion. Blinding that resolver back to the
literal `["in-progress"]` left all 14 existing scheduler test files green (145/145). Two independent
harness properties made the conversion invisible:

  1. `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles` returns the LEGACY ids and nothing else when the store has no
     `listWorkflowDefinitions` method (project-lane-vocabulary.ts — an intentional degrade so an
     unreadable workflow list cannot fail a sweep). The shared scheduler harness does not define it,
     so the resolved set and the literal set were EQUAL BY CONSTRUCTION in every existing test.
  2. `listTasks` was mocked as `vi.fn(async () => tasks)`, ignoring its `column` filter entirely. A
     mock that returns every task regardless of the lane asked for cannot detect a wrong lane.

Either property alone is enough to make a column-set defect unobservable; both were present. So this
harness supplies `listWorkflowDefinitions` AND filters `listTasks` by column — the two things the
assertion below actually depends on.

WHAT BREAKS WITHOUT THE CONVERSION. On a board whose WIP lane is `building`, the literal read asks
for `in-progress`, finds nothing, and the in-flight dependent is never reconciled. It keeps
`blockedBy` pointing at a task that no longer exists — permanently, because the blocker can never be
completed or re-deleted to trigger another sweep. Work stops with nothing to rescue it.

DIFFERENTIAL. Both vocabularies run the same workflow SHAPE with identical traits; only the ids
differ, and no renamed id collides with a legacy literal. The default-vocabulary run is the control:
it passes with or without the conversion, so a generic break in this path cannot hide here.
