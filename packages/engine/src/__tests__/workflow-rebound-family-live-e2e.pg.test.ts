/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-28-12:40 (E2E — closing rebound-family ledger entries):

`resolveReboundTarget` answers ONE question — "where does a recovered card go back
to?" — and the ledger listed four unproven callers of it. Re-checked with the lens
the previous slice corrected ("what does the function actually touch?", not "what
family does it sit in"): the self-healing pair needs NO git, so it is covered here.

WHAT A WRONG ANSWER COSTS. Keyed on the literal `todo`, a recovered card on a
renamed board is requeued to a column that board does not declare. That is not a
cosmetic mismatch — an undeclared column carries NO trait flags, so
`findColumn` returns undefined and the card is invisible to every trait-driven
sweep: nothing schedules it, nothing releases it, and the board does not draw the
column. The "recovery" strands the card more thoroughly than the failure it was
recovering from. `reconcileUndeclaredTaskColumns` exists precisely to repair that
state, which makes it the worst possible place for the bug to live.

Covered here:
  self-healing.ts  reconcileUndeclaredTaskColumns      — the undeclared-column repair
  self-healing.ts  autoRecoverWorktreeSessionStartFailure — the session-start requeue

Assertions read the PERSISTED row back through `getTask`; the audit rows are read
back through the store's own reader.

    that WAS declared until U11 removed it from the default lineage, on the REAL `builtin:coding`

    That difference matters: `triage` is still a legal `ColumnId` and is still declared by
    legacy-coding, Ideas and every linear built-in (R11), so nothing rejects it and nothing throws.
    The card simply sits in a column its OWN workflow no longer declares, where — per the file
    header — it carries no trait flags and is invisible to every trait-driven sweep.

    Proven below with progress and plan artifacts, because re-homing targets the HOLD column and a

      This passes, and my first explanation of WHY was wrong. I claimed the rescue came from U11's
      undeclared-source escape hatch in `resolveAllowedColumns`. Mutation-tested: stubbing that
      hatch back to `[]` leaves this test GREEN, so the hatch is not what saves the card.

      The real reason is narrower and worth knowing. `moves.ts` gates its entire workflow-adjacency
      block on `useWorkflow = isWorkflowColumnsCompatibilityFlagEnabled(...)`, which reads the RAW
      `experimentalFeatures.workflowColumns` key — and nothing in production writes that key, so it
      reads false. The block containing `resolveAllowedColumns` therefore does not execute on the
      live move path at all; the legacy `VALID_TRANSITIONS` path does, and `triage -> todo` is a
      legal legacy transition. That is what makes the card movable.

      So caveat 2 is survivable, but by the LEGACY table rather than by the trait-resolved hatch —
      and the hatch I added in #2515 only covers projects that have the compat flag on, which is
      approximately none. This is U2b ("converge the two move paths", never done) surfacing: a fix
      landed on the dead branch. Recorded here rather than silently relied upon, because the
      difference decides whether the hatch may be deleted as dead code later.

      The assertion is deliberately about the OUTCOME an operator sees, not about which branch
      produced it, so it stays true whichever path is authoritative after U2b converges them.
