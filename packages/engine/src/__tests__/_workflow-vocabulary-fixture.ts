ONE definition of the renamed-vs-default vocabularies and ONE workflow builder,
shared by every live-engine E2E in this directory.

Extracted (a pure move — the lifecycle suite it came from is unchanged) the moment
a SECOND suite needed it. Two copies of a differential fixture is the failure this
whole program keeps hitting: the copies drift, and then a renamed-workflow test
passes for a reason that has nothing to do with the code under test. The
differential only means anything while both vocabularies come from one builder and
differ ONLY in their four column ids.

  Before this field `lifecycleIr` emitted NO intake trait for a non-merged board, so the
  SEPARATE-LANES shape this fixture is supposed to provide did not exist. Every renamed-versus-
  merged differential built on it compared "no intake" against "intake and hold on one column",
  not "two distinct lanes" against "one".

  That let assertions pass for the wrong reason: `expect(lifecycle?.intake).not.toBe(hold)` is
  vacuously true when `intake` is `undefined`, so it would pass against a resolver that never
  resolved intake at all. `undefined` is no longer reachable from this fixture.

  `mergedIntakeAndHold` remains the way a caller forces the merged shape; a vocabulary whose
  `intake` equals its `hold` now implies it too, so the merged vocabularies cannot silently lose
  their intake trait to a forgotten option.

  FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-00:10 (fix-forward, surfaced by a typecheck that reaches here):
  `intake` was MISSING, which is a type error `Vocabulary` already forbade — invisible because the engine
  tsconfig has `exclude: ["src/__tests__/**"]`, so nothing in this directory is typechecked. It surfaced
  only when a test OUTSIDE that directory (`src/notification/__tests__/`) imported this fixture.

  Not cosmetic. `lifecycleIr` derives `merged` from `options.mergedIntakeAndHold === true || v.intake ===
  v.hold`; with `intake` undefined the second test was false, so MERGED_VOCAB alone produced a SEPARATE
  intake column whose `id` was `undefined` — a malformed IR, and precisely the "assertions pass for the
  wrong reason" failure the note at the top of this file warns about.

  `todo` is the correct value: this vocabulary documents itself as the board where intake and hold are one
  column, and `todo` is genuinely the merged Planning id after U11. Behaviour-neutral for every current
  caller — all four pass `mergedIntakeAndHold: true`, so `merged` was already true and `v.intake` was
  never read. It now also holds for a caller that forgets the option.
