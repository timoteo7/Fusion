/**
 * FNXC:CodeOrganization 2026-08-03-12:20:
 * requestPreMergeOptionalStepFix peeled from TaskExecutor (U4).
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowOptionalStepFix 2026-09-13-04:34:
 * Inline graph optional-step remediation consumes `postReviewFixCount` before calling `sendTaskBackForFix`, matching self-healing's budget-first ordering. Every persistent optional-step REVISE loop is bounded by the resolved budget; `"unbounded"` removes only a lower configurable limit and never bypasses the shared absolute safety cap.
 *
 * FNXC:PlanReviewReplan 2026-09-13-04:34:
 * Plan Review combines its workflow/node budget, `planReviewReplanCap`, and the shared absolute cap by choosing the lowest value. Exhaustion parks visibly before another planner or reviewer dispatch; other review gates use the same finite backstop and remain parked in review.
 *
 * FNXC:ReviewRemediationBudget 2026-09-08-02:13:
 * Live deterministic Verification uses the same advisory-locked work-and-charge publication as Code Review. Resolving its keyed budget before calling the named-remediation producer prevents the legacy no-claim appender path from publishing executable work without an attempt entry and aggregate increment.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowRevisionBudget 2026-06-30-22:04:
 * Plan Review and Code Review caps are independent policy budgets, so attempts are counted by workflow step key instead of the legacy aggregate `postReviewFixCount`. The aggregate still increments for existing dashboard summaries, but it must not let a Plan Review replan consume a Code Review remediation slot.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowRemediation 2026-07-03-20:10:
 * Pre-merge optional-step / Plan Review failure handoff: missing required artifacts
 * recover in place; Plan Review REVISE drives triage replan with revision budget + hard cap;
 * other REVISE verdicts bounce via sendTaskBackForFix.
 *
 * FNXC:PlanReviewReplan 2026-07-05-17:32:
 * FN-7561: malformed advisory_failure without REVISE must never replan.
 *
 * FNXC:PlanReviewReplan 2026-07-15-12:00:
 * FN-7977: provider/model/transport failures without REVISE stay in place.
 *
 * FNXC:RemediationVisibility 2026-07-26-19:20:
 * Unscheduled remediation (zero budget, non-REVISE hard fail) must log loudly, never silently park.
 *
 * FNXC:RemediationVisibility 2026-08-28-12:16:
 * A blocking result that cannot become remediation must also explain the refusal on the card, including the gate identity, concrete budget or scope state, and the operator's retry or privileged-bypass remedies. Engine-only warnings are not visible where operators diagnose a frozen review.

`\u0000` was a sound "cannot occur in the content" choice. FN-267 then PERSISTED it as
`remediationAttemptSignature` on the step result -- and PostgreSQL rejects NUL in text/jsonb with
SQLSTATE 22P05 (`unsupported Unicode escape sequence`). Every remediation claim write therefore
THREW against a real database while passing every mock-store test, because a JS string carries

Measured on FN-270/FN-273: from the moment the claim protocol landed, a Code Review REVISE could
never be claimed, so no fix steps were ever produced and the cards sat blocked overnight with an
empty timeline. Reproduced against real PostgreSQL in
`review-remediation-claim.pg.test.ts`; no mock-store test can observe this.
