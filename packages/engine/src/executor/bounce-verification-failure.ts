/**
 * FNXC:VerificationRemediation 2026-08-26-04:58:
 * The bounce shape for a red deterministic verification (the FN-3345 gate in run-implementation.ts,
 * which runs `testCommand`/`buildCommand` after every planned step succeeds and BEFORE the in-review
 * handoff). A failing verification must hand the executor NAMED work to do, never a bare bounce.
 *
 * `stepReopenPolicy` decides the shape, and the two are not interchangeable:
 *
 *  - `reopen-trailing` — the workflow expects the trailing completed step to be reopened and redone
 *    in place. `sendTaskBackForFix` performs that reopen itself. `builtin:coding` and stepwise
 *    workflows retaining the default parse contract use this policy.
 *  - `none` — the workflow declared (`parse.implementationOnlySteps` + `preserveRemediationSteps`)
 *    that remediation arrives as APPENDED named steps, so nothing may be reopened.
 *
 * The defect this seam exists to fix: `none` used to reach `sendTaskBackForFix` all the same, which
 * under that policy reopens nothing (send-task-back-for-fix.ts guards the reopen on
 * `reopen-trailing`). The task bounced back to implementation with ZERO pending steps, the foreach
 * answered `already-expanded`, and the card walked on to Code Review with the failing command
 * unaddressed — the verification result was measured, reported, and then silently discarded.
 * Measured on builtin:coding-ideas, the only built-in that selects `none`.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowIdentity 2026-09-14-19:06:
A built-in revision retains its original identity. Migration 0079 converges persisted references before catalog reads, so selection, configuration and capacity use the same raw workflow id without redirects.
 * `stepReopenPolicy: none`, while Coding (Auto) continues through the default stepwise
 * `reopen-trailing` path; comments and recovery routing must not treat the composition-only base
 * IR as another offered workflow.
 *
 * `appendReviewRemediationSteps` is the existing authority for the appended shape (it already serves
 * the Code Review gate). Its `Verification` branch has been caller-less since the graph's
 * `verification` node was removed, which is why the gap was invisible: the code was present and
 * correct, and nothing called it. It derives one step per file named in the failing output, widens
 * the PROMPT.md File Scope to those files, and performs the bounce ITSELF — so this path must not
 * bounce again.
 *
 * It returns a non-blocking release when it cannot derive work (unchanged normalized verification
 * evidence, out-of-scope-only evidence, or no actionable findings). A follow-up `sendTaskBackForFix`
 * would create the empty executor bounce this contract forbids, so released outcomes stop here
 * without lifecycle mutation.
 *
 * FNXC:ReviewRemediationBudget 2026-09-08-02:24:
 * Final deterministic verification explicitly requests an accounting claim from the executor
 * adapter. The adapter resolves the workflow/project ceiling and synthetic verification episode;
 * the strict producer then publishes the named work, keyed attempt, and aggregate charge together.
