## Worktree Boundaries

You are running in an **isolated git worktree**. This means:

- **All code changes must be made inside the current worktree directory.** Do not modify files outside the worktree.
- **Exception — Project memory:** You MAY read and write to files under \`.fusion/memory/\` at the project root to save durable project learnings.
- **Exception — Task attachments:** You MAY read files under \`.fusion/tasks/{taskId}/attachments/\` at the project root for context.
- **Exception — Sibling task specs:** You MAY read \`.fusion/tasks/{taskId}/PROMPT.md\` and \`.fusion/tasks/{taskId}/task.json\` at the project root (read-only) to consult dependency tasks' specifications. If those files do not exist, the dependency has been archived — call \`fn_task_show\` with its ID to load the spec from the archive.
- **Shell commands** run inside the worktree by default. Avoid using \`cd\` to navigate outside the worktree.

## Begin

${hasProgress
    ? `Resume from Step ${task.currentStep}. Do NOT redo completed steps.`
    : "Start with Step 0 (Preflight). Work through each step in order."}
Use \`fn_task_update\` to report progress on every step transition; its \`step\` value is 0-based and equals the \`### Step N:\` number in PROMPT.md.
Use \`fn_task_log\` for important actions and decisions.
Use \`fn_task_create\` for truly separate follow-up work, including unrelated/pre-existing broad-suite failures.
Commit at step boundaries: \`git commit -m "feat(${task.id}): complete Step N — <short summary>"${sourceIssueRef ? ` -m "Ref: ${sourceIssueRef}"` : ""}${authorArg}\`
The \`<short summary>\` is required — replace it with a concrete 5–10 word description of what the step changed.
When all steps are complete: call \`fn_task_done()\`

If a build command is configured, run that exact command in this worktree before calling \`fn_task_done()\`.
Treat a non-zero exit code as a blocking failure. Do not claim success without a real passing run.
Run impacted/package-scoped tests before completion. Run the configured workspace test command only when the task/workflow explicitly requires it or after impacted checks pass for final integration. If any broad command fails, classify the failure before editing: caused-by-this-task failures are blocking; unrelated or pre-existing failures should be logged and split into a follow-up instead of expanding this task.
If the repo has a lint command (e.g. \`pnpm lint\`, \`npm run lint\`), run it before \`fn_task_done()\` and fix any failures it reports.
If the repo has a typecheck command, run it before \`fn_task_done()\` and fix any failures it reports.
Use \`fn_task_create\` for truly separate follow-up work, including unrelated/pre-existing broad-suite failures.
If lint is configured and failing, fix that too before completion.
Do not repeatedly rerun a broad failing or hanging workspace command without a new hypothesis and a narrower confirming command.`;
