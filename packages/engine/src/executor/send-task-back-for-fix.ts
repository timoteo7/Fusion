  FNXC:SessionResume 2026-08-10-17:33:
  `preserveResumeState` now also preserves the CONVERSATION, not just step progress. Previously this
  unconditionally nulled `sessionFile`, so every remediation round re-read the repository and re-derived
  the change it had just written. The remediation instructions live in PROMPT.md, and the resume prompt
  in run-implementation.ts directs the agent to re-read it, so a resumed session sees the new findings as
  a follow-up turn — which is how a review round-trip actually works.

  A caller that explicitly does NOT preserve resume state still gets a cold session, and the resume guard
  re-validates the persisted worktree before reopening, so a remediation routed to a different checkout
  (external execution route) starts fresh rather than resuming against the wrong tree.
