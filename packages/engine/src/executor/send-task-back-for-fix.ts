  FNXC:ReviewBounceCapacityHandOff 2026-10-02-00:20:
  ORDERING. The replay step (step 4) is written to the DURABLE ledger, and the hand-off (step 6) is a
  best-effort async bounce that can lose the race for WIP capacity. Before FUSI-068 these two were
  independently durable with nothing reconciling them: the step was committed unconditionally, the
  hand-off was fire-and-forget, and a capacity loss (or a crash between them) stranded a real Code
  Review REVISE forever — the pending step kept the merge door closed, no sweep was keyed on a
  non-terminal step, and the card was auto-disposed as a permanent deadlock.

  They are now COUPLED, not independently durable: `performWorkflowRerunBounce` records a DURABLE
  capacity wait on the exact `capacity-exhausted` rejection (the same durable continuation shape the
  graph's own capacity-suspend writes), so the moment the hand-off loses the race the delivery path
  becomes durable alongside the already-committed step. A crash between step 4 and step 6 is still
  theoretically possible for the fraction of a second before the bounce timer fires — that residual
  window is what the Step-5 undelivered-replay SHAPE sweep is the backstop for, and why this comment
  must not be "simplified" back into treating the two writes as independent. The bounce itself also
  still refuses an empty hand-off (FN-267 `hasPendingReviewRemediationWork`), so reordering must never
  make a pending-step-less bounce reachable.

  //    bounce AFTER the task leaves the mergeable in-review column (see
  //    clearTerminalStepFailuresForRetry), NOT here — clearing them while the
  //    task is still in-review would drop the merge blocker during the async

  FNXC:SessionResume 2026-08-10-17:33:
  `preserveResumeState` now also preserves the CONVERSATION, not just step progress. Previously this
  unconditionally nulled `sessionFile`, so every remediation round re-read the repository and re-derived
  the change it had just written. The remediation instructions live in PROMPT.md, and the resume prompt
  in run-implementation.ts directs the agent to re-read it, so a resumed session sees the new findings as
  a follow-up turn — which is how a review round-trip actually works.

  A caller that explicitly does NOT preserve resume state still gets a cold session, and the resume guard
  re-validates the persisted worktree before reopening, so a remediation routed to a different checkout
  (external execution route) starts fresh rather than resuming against the wrong tree.
