/**
 * FNXC:CodeOrganization 2026-08-03-09:20:
 * recoverFailedPreMergeWorkflowStep peeled from TaskExecutor (U4).
 *
 * Auto-revive an `in-review` task whose pre-merge workflow step(s) failed, by replaying
 * the same send-back-for-fix flow the executor uses during a live run. Invoked by
 * SelfHealingManager's `recoverReviewTasksWithFailedPreMergeSteps` scan when a task is
 * parked in review with a failed pre-merge step and no active session. Picks the latest
 * failed pre-merge workflow step result, injects feedback into PROMPT.md, resets steps,
 * and schedules todo → in-progress. Independently enforces the effective finite-or-unlimited
 * revision budget before it can reopen work.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowPostMerge 2026-06-26-14:00:
 * U7c: gate-ness is now sourced from the recorded `WorkflowStepResult.status`, NOT a
 * `workflow_steps` table read. The graph executor (workflow-graph-executor.ts) maps a
 * group outcome to status by gate semantics: a GATE REVISE / hard failure records
 * `status: "failed"` (blocking), while an ADVISORY REVISE records `status:
 * "advisory_failure"` (non-blocking). So a pre-merge result with `status === "failed"`
 * IS by construction a blocking gate failure — the prior `getWorkflowStep(id).gateMode`
 * lookup was redundant (and after the table drop it returned undefined for graph node
 * ids anyway). Recovery revives the task from the latest blocking pre-merge failure.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowRevisionBudget 2026-07-22-18:30:
 * Failed-step recovery is also a remediation entry point, not merely a
 * retry-label formatter. Enforce the same finite Code Review budget here
 * as live and restart-local graph remediation: an unset policy remains
 * unlimited, while zero or an exhausted explicit cap cannot silently send
 * work back for another fix. Progress-loop termination stays owned by the
 * graph executor's signature guard rather than this budget check.
