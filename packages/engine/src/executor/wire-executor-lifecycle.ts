  FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:20 (was FLAGGED AND LEFT COUNTED; RESOLVED below —
  still do NOT convert with `resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync` / `resolvePlannerLanes`):

  Four lifecycle literals live in this listener and they are genuinely wrong on a renamed board:
  execution never starts on a move INTO the board's own wip lane, terminal session release never
  runs on a move into its archive lane, and the two `from` guards never fire, so in-flight work is
  not aborted when a card leaves implementation. Nothing errors; the engine simply stops reacting.

  THE OBVIOUS FIX IS INERT, AND THAT IS NOW PROVED RATHER THAN ARGUED. `task:moved` is emitted
  synchronously, so an await here reorders this handler against every other subscriber — which
  points at the sync IR path. That path cannot answer for a renamed board, for TWO independent
  reasons (`sync-workflow-ir-second-blocker.test.ts`):

    1. `getTaskWorkflowSelectionImpl` returns `undefined` unconditionally under PostgreSQL, so
       `resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync` always takes its `!workflowId` branch;
    2. even with a selection, the CUSTOM-workflow branch loads its IR through `store.db`, whose
       implementation is an unconditional throw — so it falls into the catch and returns the
       DEFAULT IR anyway.

  A renamed lane IS a custom workflow, so (2) alone is decisive: the sync path can never serve this
  listener's case. `check-inert-sync-lane-conversions` already baselines twenty guards in exactly
  that state in `scheduler.ts`; these four must not join them.

  They stay literal and COUNTED, which is the honest state — an unconverted literal is visible to
  the census, while an inert conversion leaves the backlog and takes the evidence with it.

  THE CRITERION IS NARROWER THAN "THE LISTENER IS SYNC", and I got this wrong first time elsewhere:
  what blocks a guard is whether ITS ANSWER IS CONSUMED SYNCHRONOUSLY, not whether it happens to sit
  inside a synchronous function. In `self-healing.ts`'s fan-out, three of four guards only gated work
  the listener already `void`s, so they were reachable by the async resolver all along and are now
  converted. These four are NOT that case, for two independent reasons:

    A. `trackTaskDisposal` writes `pendingTaskDisposals` in THIS tick, and the `to === wip` branch
       above READS that map to serialise a fast bounce (in-progress -> todo -> in-progress; the
       FN-5256 note it carries). Deferring the branch selection to a microtask lets the second
       event's prologue read the map before the first event's write lands — which reopens exactly
       the race that comment exists to close.
    B. This is an if / else-if CHAIN, so the guards are entangled: converting one changes which
       branch a move falls into. They convert together or not at all, and (A) blocks the set.

  UNBLOCKING therefore needs the async resolver reachable from a SYNCHRONOUS consumer, which means
  either a sync reader that answers for custom workflows AND survives a writer on another node, or
  restructuring the disposal bookkeeping so nothing is read in-tick — the constraints are written up
  in `sync-workflow-ir-second-blocker.test.ts`.

  FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:55 — RESOLVED BY A THIRD ROUTE, and the analysis above
  is kept because it is what rules the other two out.

  The block reduces to "no resolver can be CALLED here". It never required that the answer be
  unavailable — only that this listener cannot go and fetch it. So the lanes are resolved ONCE by
  the emitter, which is already async, and ride along on the event payload (`moves.ts`). Every
  objection above is about calling a resolver in-tick, so none of them survive the move:

    - (2)/the PostgreSQL sync-IR dead end: no sync resolver is used, so neither blocker applies.
    - (A) the in-tick `pendingTaskDisposals` race: NO await is introduced. Destructuring one more
      field is as synchronous as reading `to`, so branch selection still happens in this tick and
      the FN-5256 fast-bounce serialisation is untouched.
    - (B) the entangled if / else-if chain: satisfied rather than dodged — all four convert in
      this one commit, so no move can fall into a different branch than before.

  THE RESIDUAL RISK MOVES TO THE EMITTER, AND IT IS NOT YET CLOSED — stated plainly because the
  tempting version of this note is the false one. `lanes` is OPTIONAL on the payload
  (`store.ts`: `lanes?: TaskMoveLanes`) and the fallback below is the LEGACY LITERAL, so a
  `task:moved` published without it leaves these four guards exactly as inert as before, on a
  renamed board, with nothing failing. The conversion is only as good as the emitters.

  That is a strictly better position than the flagged state — the fallback is reached on one path
  instead of every path, and `moves.ts` (the move path these branches actually serve) does pass
  lanes — but it is NOT the compile-time guarantee it would be if the field were required.
  Requiring it is the right end state and is deliberately NOT done here: it retypes every
  `task:moved` emitter, which is its own change with its own blast radius, and bundling it would
  put a mechanical retype in the same commit as this behavior change.

  FOLLOW-UP, tracked with the emitter-side work: either make `lanes` required, or add a gate that
  asserts every `task:moved` emit site supplies it. Until one of those lands, treat the fallback
  as a live inertness path rather than defensive dead code.
