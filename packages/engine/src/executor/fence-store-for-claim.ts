/**
 * FNXC:LifecycleContainment 2026-08-30-13:36:
 * FN-267 raised the supersession boundary from a per-call-site guard to a STORE FENCE.
 *
 * Guarding sites one at a time does not converge: `requestPreMergeOptionalStepFix` writes durable,
 * operator-facing state from more than a dozen branches (operator-hold refusal, empty-content close,
 * plan-review replan, both convergence rungs, budget refusals, the workspace review-state write, the
 * attempt counter), and each review round found the next unguarded one. A task-log entry cannot be
 * withdrawn by a later fenced refusal, so ANY missed branch permanently attributes an old review
 * round's outcome to a newer one.
 *
 * The fence inverts that: a claimed run gets a store whose durable writers re-assert ownership first
 * and throw {@link ClaimSupersededError} when the claim is gone. The caller converts that to a silent
 * "nothing scheduled", so a branch added later is fenced by construction rather than by review.
 * `reassertRemediationAttempt` runs against the RAW store, so the fence cannot recurse through it.
