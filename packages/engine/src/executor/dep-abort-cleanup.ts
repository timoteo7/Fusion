  FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-29-15:10 (P0 audit after the Planning-column merge):
  This wrote the LITERAL `triage`. The default coding lineage no longer declares that column —
  it has one pre-implementation column, id `todo` — so a card that gained a dependency
  mid-execution had its work discarded and was then parked in a column its own workflow does
  not define. Nothing in the graph routes a card out of an undeclared column, and the only
  rescue is `reconcileUndeclaredTaskColumns` on the NEXT ENGINE START, so between the abort and
  a restart the card is stalled with no automatic recovery. It does not throw, which is why it
  would have surfaced as a user report rather than a red test.

  Resolve the rebound target from the task's own workflow (hold -> intake -> first declared
  column), the same helper the other ~16 executor rebounds already use.
