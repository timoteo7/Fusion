        THIS BOOLEAN IS THE OWNERSHIP BOUNDARY, and it is too narrow. `runImplementation` has
        28 measured ways of disposing of a task (16 column moves, 3 review handoffs, 9 terminal
        parks — counted by `executor-lifecycle-ownership-ledger.test.ts`) and exactly 3 ways of
        telling the graph anything, all of which collapse to `taskDone: true` here.

        The consequence is not a missing feature, it is a second lifecycle owner. Because the
        seam has no value for "the agent stopped because a step is blocked on a pending review"
        or "the session was paused after the work was already complete", the implementation
        phase performs those transitions ITSELF (`executor-exit-while-review-pending`,
        `paused-after-completion`) and the graph learns about them afterwards — which is why
        `handleGraphFailure` carries `alreadyFinalizedToReview` / `completionFinalized`
        classifiers whose whole job is to recognise a move the graph did not make.

        U8's direction: widen this vocabulary so a disposition is REPORTED here and the graph
        routes it, rather than performed upstream and compensated for downstream. The
        compensating classifiers are the acceptance test — they become unreachable, and then
        deletable, exactly when the last out-of-band transition is gone.

        handoffs left NO trace anywhere that the executor — not the graph — moved the card;
        they surfaced as an ordinary `implementation-incomplete` failure that
        `handleGraphFailure` then quietly compensated for. An operator could not tell the two
        apart, and neither could a test.

        Emission is deliberately AFTER the phase and BEFORE the return, and it changes nothing:
        the outcome/value below are byte-identical to what this seam returned before, for every
        exit, which `executor-implementation-exit-events.test.ts` pins by driving each exit and
        asserting the seam's return. Per R5 an exit id is a REACTION — dropping every subscriber
