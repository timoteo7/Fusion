 * FN-180 requires the workflow-resolved replay policy to be the only authority after a review
 * rejection. Step-title heuristics created a second authority that could make a confirmed merge's
 * checklist stale. A permitted replay targets exactly the last actionable completed step; workflows
 * that must preserve remediation steps select the `none` policy before reaching this helper.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowStepReopenAuthority 2026-08-28-15:11:
 * A completed step is immutable execution history. The single replay authority appends a new pending
 * occurrence instead of rewriting the completed occurrence, while existing pending work prevents
 * duplicate growth.

    Give the appended replay occurrence a distinguishable identity (FUSI-068). Under FN-180 the
    COMPLETED occurrence stays immutable and this new pending occurrence clones its name, which
    leaves the two indistinguishable by name alone — the fingerprint that made a lost capacity
    hand-off read as "nothing happened". `replay` is additive JSONB (no migration), is NOT the
    `remediation` field (that one makes `parse-steps` preserve the full step list forever), and is
    FORWARD-ONLY: a card stranded before this field existed still has name-clone twins, so the
    undelivered-replay predicate keys on the durable shape, not this field.
