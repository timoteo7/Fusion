FNXC:WorkflowRecoveryPolicy 2026-07-27-23:10 (U4 — the surfacing family):

ONE runner for the three surfacing sweeps — `surfaceStalePausedTodos`,
`surfaceStalePausedReviews`, `surfaceInReviewStalled`. They are migrated together
so the family cannot drift apart: before this they were three copies of the same
skeleton, and a fix applied to one (the FN-5719-era dedup, the fresh-row skip)
had to be remembered for the other two.

WHAT THE RUNNER OWNS (identical in all three, and the bulk of each body):
  - the global pause gates;
  - the threshold resolution, now POLICY-OVER-SETTING;
  - the fresh-row skip (a row updated during this cycle is re-read next pass);
  - the at-most-once dedup keyed on the durable log prefix + signal code;
  - the log write, the count, and the never-throw contract.

WHAT EACH SPEC OWNS (genuinely per-sweep):
  - which lifecycle ROLE it watches and which operator setting it inherits;
  - its eligibility predicate;
  - its signal evaluation and its operator-facing sentence.

SAFEGUARD POSITION: surfacing is OBSERVATIONAL. Per the re-ratified invariant the
user-pause safeguard gates lifecycle MUTATION, not observation, so these sweeps
report on user-paused cards — which is their entire purpose. The runner writes a
task-log entry and mutates no lifecycle field. It must stay that way: adding a
mutating action here would need the safeguard, and that is why the action is not
parameterized.

AT-MOST-ONCE is a SAFEGUARD and lives here, outside the policy table: a workflow
must not be able to author repeated notification of the same signal.

Extracted helper of the unattended self-healing / scheduler sweeps, so its store writes carry
the same MARKER as the sweeps that call it: a timer-driven repair has no session, no request,
and no acting agent, and the only ids in scope name the SUBJECT of the write rather than its
author. Counted by `unattributed-actor-census.test.ts`; U13 owns whether these lanes get a real

merge lane beside a human-review lane has two review columns. `resolveLifecycleColumns()[role]`
answers with the FIRST one only, so the role gate below (`task.column !== roleColumn`) dropped every
card resting in any other column carrying the same role: no stale-paused-review, no in-review-stalled,
no stale-paused-todo diagnostic for those cards, silently and with no error.

Membership, not first-match. `review` is the union of the three review roles (the same answer
`resolveReviewColumns` gives every other converted reader) so a board splitting merge orchestration
from human review is covered by both.
