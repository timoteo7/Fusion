    Keyed on the ROLE, because keyed on the id this returned null for every card on a renamed board.

    The blast radius is why this is worth the parameter rather than a fallback: `observeTask` returns
    early on a null stage, so no observation is recorded, no `overseer:intervention` entry is emitted,
    and `PlannerRecoveryController` — which consumes those observations — has nothing to steer, retry
    or targeted-fix. The entire oversight loop went inert and said nothing about it, the same shape as
    the self-healing sweeps whose queries returned empty arrays.

    THE FLAGS ARRIVE AS A PARAMETER because this function is pure and sync with no store and no task
    id to resolve from. The cost objection I recorded when first auditing this — "resolving inside
    `observeTask` buys a workflow read per card per poll" — turned out to be answered by the caller:
    `project-engine.ts`'s poll ALREADY awaits `resolveEffectiveSettings` per task, so it is a per-task
    async loop already, and an IR cache keyed by workflow makes the addition (distinct workflows)
    resolutions rather than (cards).

    THE REVIEW TEST IS THE THREE-TRAIT UNION, not `isReviewColumnRole`, which checks only
    `mergeBlocker || humanReview`. A board whose review lane carries `merge` (mergeOrchestration) —
    the default's own shape — would otherwise be classified as not-in-review and skipped, which is the
    bug this change is removing, arriving through the helper meant to fix it.

    `columnFlags` is in the unwired-lane-parameter vocabulary, so the wiring cannot silently rot.

FNXC:WorkflowReviewGates 2026-07-26-16:50:
Gate-anchored stall detection for the in-review stages. Neither the `reviewer` nor the `merger`
branch had ANY time-based check — both fell through to `progressing` unconditionally. That was
tolerable while the pre-merge gates ran in `in-progress` (the FN-7743 executor check covered them),
but Code Review / Browser Verification now run with the card in `in-review`, so a hung gate that
never posts a verdict produced no stall signal at all, however long it hung.

Applied to BOTH in-review stages deliberately: `resolveWatchedStage` maps a plain in-review card
with no `reviewState` to `merger`, not `reviewer`, so a task running its first gate usually lands
in the merger branch. The pending pre-merge lease is the authoritative "a gate is running" fact
regardless of which sub-stage was inferred.

Anchored on the gate's own `startedAt`, never `columnMovedAt`: the latter conflates "entered
review" with "gate started" and would fire during a legitimate human merge-wait — the false
positive that would make the signal untrustworthy. Only engages while a pre-merge result is
actually `pending`; a card whose gates have settled and is awaiting a human merge stays
`progressing`.

Reuses the resolved `executorStuckAfterMs` threshold — this is a hung agent session, the same
failure the executor check covers, so it needs no second setting. The reason is bucketed to whole
hours so the FN-7577 `stage|signal|reason` feed dedup stays effective (it must never embed a
changing millisecond value). A missing/malformed timestamp degrades to no signal; never fabricate a
stall. The FN-7514 human-control guard still runs upstream, so `autoMerge:false` rows stay
human-owned regardless of what this returns.
