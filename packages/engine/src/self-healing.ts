/**
 * SelfHealingManager — enables unattended multi-day/week operation by
 * providing automatic recovery from common failure modes.
 *
 * Four subsystems:
 * 1. **Auto-unpause**: Clears rate-limit-triggered `globalPause` with
 *    escalating backoff (5 min → 60 min cap). Resets on sustained unpause.
 * 2. **Stuck kill budget**: Caps how many times a task can be killed by the
 *    stuck-task detector before marking it as permanently failed.
 * 3. **Periodic maintenance**: Worktree pruning, orphan cleanup, SQLite
 *    WAL checkpoint — all on a configurable interval (default 15 min).
 * 4. **Worktree cap enforcement**: Prevents unbounded worktree accumulation
 *    by cleaning oldest idle worktrees when count exceeds 2× maxWorktrees.
 * 5. **Completion handoff limbo recovery**: Re-enqueues merge-eligible in-review
 *    tasks stuck after `Task marked done by agent` with missing fan-out state.
 *
 * Worktrunk ownership/deference table (`worktrunk.enabled`):
 * - `pruneWorktrees`: defer to backend prune
 * - `cleanupOrphans`: defer to backend prune/remove semantics
 * - `reapUnregisteredOrphans`: defer to backend prune/remove semantics
 * - `cleanupStaleTempMergeWorktrees`: remains native (dedicated AI-merge root + legacy roots)
 * - `enforceWorktreeCap`: defer to backend prune/remove semantics
 * - `reclaimSelfOwnedBranchConflicts`: remains native (branch-level)
 * - `reclaimStaleActiveBranches`: remains native (branch-level)

FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2 — why every store mutation in this file carries the MARKER):
Self-healing is the engine's unattended-operation sweep: it runs on a timer, reconciles rows nobody
asked it to touch, and has no session, no request, and no acting agent behind any of its writes.
There is therefore nothing here to derive a real actor FROM — `mutationContextForAgent` would have to
be fed an agent id that names the SUBJECT of a repair rather than its author, producing audit rows
claiming a task rebounded itself.

The marker is the honest carrier for that, and it is deliberately not a system-actor identity.
Whether unattended engine sweeps get a real system actor — and what that actor may do once U5
enforces the permission catalog — is U13's design decision. Making it here would bury a semantic
choice inside a mechanical conversion, which is exactly the failure the census exists to surface:
these usages are COUNTED, so U13 inherits a work list rather than a silently-attributed sweep.

  TERMINAL — i.e. not running anymore in any sense. The Phase-D bug: the prior predicate only
  treated an in-review task WITH an active transient merge status as live, so a task still in column
  `in-progress` (executing, registered its land lease early, no merge status yet) read as NOT live →
  its lease was reclaimed MID-EXECUTION. This predicate inverts to the SAFE direction: the owner is
  LIVE unless it is provably terminal — null/missing, `done`, or `failed`. Every other state
  (`in-progress`, `in-review` with or without a merge status, `todo`, `triage`, paused, etc.) is

Preserve FN-4811 by requiring every live-owner signal to be absent, leave the FN-5219 missing-worktree path untouched, and avoid FN-5704 resume-limbo counters because this path only clears a stale binding and requeues once with progress/worktree preserved.
   *
   * FNXC:SelfHealingReclaim 2026-07-05-08:15:
   * FN-7566: the FN-6736 liveness gate (`agentPresent` heartbeat, `checkedOutBy` lease, `hasRecentRunAudit`) is structurally blind to EPHEMERAL EXECUTOR agents (`agentId: "executor"`): they never emit heartbeat runs (so `activeHeartbeatTaskIds` never contains them), never acquire a checkout lease (`checkedOutBy` stays null), and normal execution activity (sandbox:run / task:log / verification) writes no `runAuditEvents` rows (so `getRecentRunAuditActivityAgeMs` stays null). With all three permanently false, the ONLY surviving gate was age > graceMs*3 (~30 min), so any ephemeral executor task running longer than 30 minutes — a heavy foreach workflow, a slow model — was killed mid-flight on the next self-healing sweep and hard-moved to `todo`, corrupting overlapping-worktree/task-link state.
   * The fix adds the in-process live-session truth that DOES track ephemeral executors: a worktree path registered as active in `activeSessionRegistry` (the executor/step-session/workflow-step session holds it for the whole run), the `executingTaskLock`, or `isTaskActive`. This mirrors the canonical `isWorkspaceTaskLive` / `sessionDead` predicate. A genuinely leaked binding (FN-6736) still has an EMPTY registry / no lock / inactive task, so legitimate phantom recovery is preserved; a live ephemeral executor now vetoes the phantom verdict regardless of the durable-agent signals.

    THE BOARD-STALL COUNTER WAS THE ONE GUARD HERE THAT GENUINELY NEEDED A SYNCHRONOUS ANSWER, because
    it mutates in-memory state in the handler's own tick. The other two gated work the listener already
    `void`s and were converted through the async resolver; this one could not follow them.

    The sync IR path was never the answer for it either: `resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync` cannot resolve a
    CUSTOM workflow at all (two independent blockers, `sync-workflow-ir-second-blocker.test.ts`), so a
    conversion routed through it would have been inert — which is why I wrote that conversion, measured
    it, and withdrew it.

    #3109 removed the dilemma by having the EMITTER carry resolved lanes on the `task:moved` payload.
    Reading them needs NO await, so the counter's increment stays in the same tick and the guard becomes
    correct at the same time.

    `lanes` is optional and fail-soft to `undefined` — "unknown", never "legacy" — so the literals stay
    as the fallback, matching the `mergeParkedColumns` convention in `scheduler.ts`.

    WHAT IT FIXES: on a renamed board this counter read ZERO, so the board-stall watchdog was blind to
    a board whose cards were moving out of implementation the whole time — the signal it exists to
    raise was never raised.

      THESE TWO GUARDS GATE WORK THAT WAS ALREADY FIRE-AND-FORGET, so they can ask the async resolver
      without changing anything an observer can see.

      The sync-IR conversion of this listener is inert and was withdrawn (see the note above). But
      that is a constraint on the SYNC path, and only the board-stall counter above genuinely needs a
      synchronous answer — it mutates in-memory state in the handler's own tick. The two calls below
      are already `void`-ed: the listener does not await them, and their bodies already begin at a
      microtask boundary.

      Moving the guard into that same boundary therefore preserves the ordering property the withdrawn
      conversion would have broken. An async IIFE runs synchronously only up to its first `await`,
      which here is the first statement, so the rest of this listener continues in the same tick
      exactly as before — identical to how `void this.reconcileCompletedTask(...)` already behaved.

      The resolution goes through the ASYNC `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles`, whose only store read is
      `listWorkflowDefinitions()` — answerable under PostgreSQL, and unaffected by either of the two
      blockers that make the sync path inert (`sync-workflow-ir-second-blocker.test.ts`).

      What this fixes, on every renamed board: a card entering the board's own review lane never had
      its branch rebound, and a card reaching the board's own complete or archive lane never ran the
      completion fan-out — so its worktree was never reclaimed and its dependents kept a `blockedBy`
      pointing at a blocker that had already finished.

   * Incomplete stuck-loop exhaustion must park work in a failed/paused state before moving columns, because a post-move patch failure must not leave the task scheduler-runnable.
   * Engine-owned recovery must not mutate `userPaused`; user intent stays authoritative across races.

   * evidence of cross-task contamination, or just an inherited start point?"
   *
   * A task branch cut from the integration branch points at whatever landed last. When the task has not committed
   * anything of its own (planning aborted, spec revise, operator move back to `todo`), the branch tip IS that
   * previous task's commit — a foreign trailer with zero foreign intent. FN-1406 hit exactly this: `fusion/fn-1406`
   * was cut from `main` at FN-1401's landed commit, planning ended without a commit, and the reclaim sweep logged
   * `already-merged rejected ... owner=FN-1401 reason=foreign-task-tip` every pass instead of clearing the stale
   * worktree/branch metadata.

   * Merge-base-to-tip diff proof separates the two: no unique diff means the branch carries no task content, so the
   * foreign trailer is inherited and the caller may treat the row as stale metadata. The one exception is when the

  FNXC:WorkflowColumns 2026-07-29-09:30 (Phase B — self-healing intake/hold vocabulary):
  Per-sweep resolver for the two PRE-WIP lifecycle roles this file gates on.

  `triage` is INTAKE and `todo` is HOLD, but only for the built-in coding shape.
  U11 merges them into one column that KEEPS the id "todo" and DELETES "triage",
  so every `column === "triage"` here becomes a guard that silently stops matching
  the moment that IR lands — recovery disabled with a green suite, which is exactly
  the failure the plan's Problem Frame measured (82 guards that would stop matching
  without failing a test).

  caller-owned per sweep so 400 cards over three workflows read three IRs, not 400
  (the shape `resolveTaskLifecycleColumns` documents and the completed-stranded

  UNRESOLVABLE workflows return the legacy literals rather than nothing. These are
  RECOVERY sweeps: a card whose IR cannot be read must keep its current recovery
  behaviour, not silently drop out of every sweep. That is the conservative
  direction here, and it differs deliberately from conversions whose failure mode
  is a destructive move.

      FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-21:40 (#2879 review — greptile, "multi-role tasks run
      recovery twice"): DEDUPED ACROSS THE BUCKETS, NOT JUST WITHIN EACH.

      `readBucket` dedupes by id, but only inside one role's read. A custom workflow may put more than
      one queried flag on ONE column — `hold` plus `countsTowardWip` on a lane that both parks and
      counts as work, or a review role beside either — and that column is then returned by two reads.
      The task lands in two buckets, and the concatenation below hands the recovery loop the SAME
      STALE SNAPSHOT twice.

      That is not a wasted iteration: the second pass re-reads `task.branch`/`task.worktree` from a
      snapshot taken before the first pass mutated anything, so a worktree the first pass reclaimed is
      reclaimed again against state that no longer exists. The lane-resolution loop above already
      guards with `reclaimLanes.has(task.id)`; this is the same guard the consumption side was missing.

      Deduping by id preserves iteration order, and the FIRST bucket's snapshot is the one kept. Spelled
      out with an explicit `has` guard rather than `new Map(entries)`: that constructor keeps first
      INSERTION ORDER but the LAST value for a repeated key, so it would have silently given last-bucket
      precedence while this comment claimed the opposite.

            A failed `tip-already-merged` cleanup is NOT a branch conflict and must never be escalated as one.
            This verdict means the tip is already an ancestor of the integration ref — the branch has nothing unique to
            lose — so the only thing that can fail here is filesystem housekeeping, in practice `git worktree remove
            --force` losing a race with pnpm writing into the worktree's `node_modules` (`ENOTEMPTY ... rmdir`).
            Rethrowing handed that rmdir race to the outer catch, which classified it `branch-conflict-unrecoverable`
            and FAILED + paused a task whose branch was already fully merged, with the misleading error "Task branch
            conflict: <branch> is not safely reclaimable". 78 such parks were logged in 16 days, every one carrying a
            worktree-removal message rather than any git conflict.

            The reclaim is idempotent, so the correct response is to leave the row untouched and retry on the next
            sweep — which is what actually resolved these tasks minutes later anyway. Only `live-foreign` below is a
            real conflict verdict.

          dependency satisfaction"): REUSE THE SCHEDULER'S RESOLVER, DO NOT RE-DERIVE IT.

          The first version unioned all three review roles, which counts a `mergeOrchestration`-only
          column as satisfied. `resolveDependencySatisfactionColumns` — the shared answer the scheduler
          already uses for exactly this question — defines review as `mergeBlocker ∪ humanReview` and
          deliberately excludes merge orchestration. Two readers of one fact disagreeing is how this
          program has already gone wrong; the fix is to call the existing one, not to match it by hand.

          Its contract also covers the degraded case: an unresolvable dependency is left UNMAPPED, and
          the literal fallback below then answers, so a dependency whose workflow cannot be read does not
          silently read as never-satisfied and block its dependent forever.

      /*
      FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-21:40 (#2876 review — greptile, "traitless workflow
      columns stay invisible"): CONFIRMED, DEFERRED, AND THE REASON IS THAT IT IS NOT LOCAL.

      `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles` returns its legacy floor plus what workflows DECLARE for the
      role. A board that renames its lanes but declares no lifecycle traits contributes nothing, so
      the card never enters `blockedCandidates` and the per-card classification below — which is
      correct — never runs for it. Invisible before the guard is reached.

      This is the three-state rule at PROJECT scope: unreadable and untraited take the legacy answer,
      and only a board that EXPRESSES traits and still lacks the role is answering. The merge queue
      got the per-task version of this in #2819.

      NOT FIXED HERE BECAUSE A BLANKET FIX WOULD BE WRONG. The safe direction differs by caller: for
      a sweep, over-inclusion costs extra `listTasks` calls the per-card check discards; for the
      analytics aggregators (#2864, #2866) the same widening inflates a number an operator reads. It
      needs an opt-in — `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles(store, roles, { untraitedProject:
      "declared-columns" })` defaulting to today's behaviour — which is a shared-helper contract
      change touching every sweep, both aggregators and the glasses notifier.

      Premise correction for whoever writes the fixture: this is a hand-authored V2 board, not a v1
      upgrade. `synthesizeDefaultColumns` emits the DEFAULT ids with `traits: []`, so a v1-upgraded
      board cannot have a renamed lane — a v1-shaped fixture would pass vacuously.

  FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-19-04:20 (U9b / R10 / KTD-8):
  Startup adoption sweep — the live CONSUMER of the KTD-8 adoption table. U9 landed the
  table and the census that keeps it complete, but nothing ever called it, so no
  pre-cutover row was actually adopted: `planning` / `needs-replan` /
  `plan-review-unavailable` rows kept a legacy status whose writers U3 deleted, and the
  graph had no owning node to re-enter. That is the "frozen row" this exists to prevent.

  Runs at STARTUP (not steady state): adoption is a once-per-upgrade concern, and
  `legacyAdoptedAt` makes it idempotent so a restart loop cannot re-clear a status a human
  re-set or re-park a row an operator un-parked. `planLegacyAdoption` is shared with the
  store-open reconcile so the two cannot drift.

  User pauses are never disturbed — an operator park outranks adoption.

  FNXC:LegacyAdoption 2026-07-19-09:00 (PR #2335 review):
  Paginates until the active census is drained instead of scanning only the newest 500
  rows. `listTasks` orders by (created_at, id), so a capped single fetch would re-read the
  same newest page on every restart and leave older legacy rows frozen forever — the exact
  R10 failure this sweep exists to prevent. Offset pagination is stable: adoption patches

          The `catch` above was dead code. `resolveWorkflowIrById` catches every failure and

          for a failed selection read — so the resolver never rejects, and its comment ("do

          the card's own, which is the one outcome the guard was written to prevent. Found
          while trying to make a test of that guard fail (PR #2543) and being unable to.

          read only for a card otherwise about to be MOVED (rare — a healthy board reaches

          resolver whose soft-failure many other callers depend on.

   *
   * When triage cannot route a `triage`-role principal it records a `held` planning continuation and sets
   * `status: "needs-replan"`, then returns. Nothing re-drives that row: the executor's holds get bounced by
   * the recovery sweeps, but a held PLAN node is re-admitted only through triage discovery, and for a
   * hold-column card that discovery keys on `status === "needs-replan"` (a card whose PROMPT.md is already a
   * real spec is otherwise not "awaiting planning"). So the hold survives exactly as long as that status
   * does — and any unrelated writer that clears status silently ends the card's life.
   *
   * FN-8923 held on `role-pool-exhausted:triage` at 17:08, had its `needs-replan` nulled by dependency
   * auto-unblock three hours later, and then produced ZERO run-audit rows for 7+ hours: triage skipped it
   * (spec written, no replan flag) while the executor refused it (`isUnplannedForExecution` found no
   * capacity-boundary continuation). Unowned by both lanes, not looping — silent.
   *
   * The repair restores the replan signal so triage retries the routing. It is deliberately signal-only: it
   * does not retire the continuation (triage's own atomic replace does that when it takes the slot), does not
   * move columns, and never touches an operator pause. Routing exhaustion is usually transient — a busy or
   * momentarily disabled role agent — so retrying is the correct response, not parking for a human.

   * The general reclaim for continuations no dispatcher will ever look at again. See

   * only `runnable`/`retrying`, so a row that stops in `running` (dead lease, NULL expiry) or `held`
   * (reason the claim predicate cannot re-take) is silently terminal, and a soft-deleted task's rows are
   * never cascaded away.
   *
   * This is the SUPERSET sweep that `reconcilePrincipalHeldPlanningContinuations` is the narrow special
   * case of: that one restores a planning SIGNAL (`needs-replan`) so triage re-routes a held triage-role
   * plan node, which is the correct repair for its shape and is deliberately left alone here. This sweep
   * repairs the ROW, moving it back to `runnable` so the ordinary drain claims it on the next tick.
   *
   * Scan shape: `listDueWorkflowWorkItems` already filters `leaseExpiresAt IS NULL OR <= now`, so the
   * one query returns exactly the rows that could be abandoned — no per-task fan-out, and no unbounded
   * table walk. Every write is compare-and-set fenced on the state the scan observed, so a row a real
   * dispatcher claimed between scan and write is left untouched rather than reset under a live session.

  FNXC:OrphanedPendingSteps 2026-07-22-16:20 (FN-8492 incident):
  Consumer of `resolveOrphanedPendingStepResults` — the U9b helper shipped with NO caller
  (the same gap U9 left for the adoption table), so an engine restart that killed an
  in-flight pre-merge step session left its `pending` workflowStepResult behind forever.
  The merge gate read it as "incomplete pre-merge workflow steps", surfaced an identical
  stall every 30 minutes, and after 3 stalls the deadlock disposer parked the task `failed`
  (FN-8492: Code Review died in the 21:29 restart, task parked two hours later).

  FNXC:OrphanedPendingSteps 2026-07-22-16:35 (review follow-up, same day):
  Orphans are REWRITTEN to status:"failed" (never deleted) — deleting a pending review
  entry silently satisfied the merge gate and FN-8492 merged with Code Review skipped; the
  failed rewrite keeps the gate closed and hands re-run/bypass to the existing
  failed-pre-merge-steps recovery and FN-7720 operator-bypass paths.

  Runs at startup (right after legacy adoption) AND in periodic maintenance: a step
  session can die without an engine restart, and waiting for the next boot leaves the
  task riding the 3×30-min stall escalator to a deadlock park. Liveness uses the
  canonical triple (activeSessionRegistry path, executingTaskLock, isTaskActive) — live
  workflow-step sessions register their worktree path (kind "workflow-step") for their
  whole run, so a live review always vetoes. `in-progress` rows are skipped entirely:
  they are executor-owned and `resumeOrphaned()` re-attaches their sessions on a
  DEFERRED timer (getResumeOrphanDelayMs, ~30s), so at startup their liveness cannot be
  proven yet and must not be judged here. The row is re-read immediately before the
  write so the whole-array update cannot clobber a lease written after the page
  snapshot. User pauses are never disturbed.

  /*
  FNXC:StalledCardWatchdog 2026-07-26-19:40 (FN-8596 class):
  The BACKSTOP for "a card must never sit waiting". Every other sweep in this file recovers a KNOWN
  strand shape; this one exists for the shapes nobody has enumerated yet. FN-8596 was exactly that:
  a card sat in `triage` doing nothing for ten minutes with a finished spec, and no sweep, log, or
  audit event named it — the strand was only found because a human noticed the board.

  DETECT-ONLY, deliberately. It emits a run-audit event and a warning; it does NOT move, requeue,
  pause, or fail anything. A generic mutator racing the specialized sweeps is precisely the class of
  bug this file keeps fixing, so recovery stays with the sweep that owns each shape and this one
  guarantees visibility. Emitting the shape (column/status/whether a continuation or session exists)
  is what makes the next unknown strand diagnosable in one query instead of an archaeology session.

  A card counts as stalled when ALL hold:
    - it is in a non-terminal column (done/archived are finished, not waiting),
    - nothing is executing it (executing set + executingTaskLock + live session registry),
    - it has no ACTIVE workflow continuation queued to resume it,
    - it is not paused (an operator park is a deliberate wait, not a stall),
    - and it has not been touched for longer than the stall floor.
  Deduped per (taskId, shape) so a genuinely parked card does not re-emit every sweep.

          Plan Review has always had lease semantics here (`classifyReviewLease`: a `leaseOwner`
          with a `startedAt` inside the staleness floor is adopted, never re-dispatched), but the
          `code-review` / `browser-verification` optional groups write a bare `pending` record with
          no such guard. That asymmetry became reachable when those gates moved into `in-review`:
          this sweep also runs from PERIODIC MAINTENANCE, in the same live process as an active
          graph run, so a tick landing between the lease write and the session-registry
          registration could stamp a gate that just started — and is genuinely running — as
          `failed`, closing the merge gate against a task nothing is wrong with.
          Treating a within-floor lease as live closes that window. It does NOT defeat FN-8492: a
          lease past the floor classifies as `reclaim` and is still marked failed, so cleanup of a
          genuinely dead lease is delayed by at most the staleness floor — the same floor Plan
          Review already relies on. Restart-orphaned gates are unaffected in substance: nothing
          re-attaches an in-review graph run after a restart, so those leases simply age out and
          are then marked failed as before.

      EMPTY array on a board whose complete lane is renamed, so this sweep never ran — proven in
      `self-healing-query-filter-blindness.test.ts` (#2800), which asserts the query ARGUMENT because
      the outcome is 0 either way.

      `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles` is the seam that fix needed: a read happens before any task is in
      hand, so there is nothing to resolve a per-task lane from. It answers the PROJECT-level question —
      every column any workflow here declares for the role — and unions the legacy ids, so a board
      mid-rename still surfaces rows stored under the old one.

      Same three-line shape as `stale-task-reporter` and `backlog-pressure-reporter`: resolve the roles,
      iterate the set, dedupe by id.

      FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-17:20 (#2838 review — greptile P1):
      THE PROJECT UNION IS FOR THE QUERY, NEVER FOR THE PER-CARD TEST. My first version re-asserted
      `completeColumns.has(task.column)`, which is the flat-set mistake `project-lane-vocabulary.ts`
      warns about in its own header — a card is claimed as complete because SOME OTHER workflow in the
      project calls its column complete. On a project with two boards, one naming its wip lane the same
      as another's complete lane, this sweep would rewrite merge evidence onto a card still being worked.

      Widening the read and widening the verdict are different decisions. The read must over-include
      (a missed row is invisible); the verdict must not (a wrong row is a write). So the candidate filter
      resolves each card against ITS OWN workflow.

        drops renamed completions"):

        PROVENANCE, BECAUSE THIS RESOLVER DOES NOT FAIL — IT SUBSTITUTES.

        `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` degrades to the BUILT-IN coding IR rather than throwing, so the
        `.catch(() => undefined)` protected almost nothing: when a task's selection cannot be resolved
        the call SUCCEEDS and hands back a board whose complete lane is `done`. The old line then read
        `ownComplete.length > 0` as "this card answered", so a renamed-lane card was measured against
        the built-in vocabulary, rejected, and — because this sweep is the thing that would have
        repaired its missing merge evidence — rejected again on every subsequent sweep.

        The provenance form separates "the card's own workflow says complete = X" from "nobody could
        say, here is the default". Only the first is an answer.

        THE VERDICT IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED, AND I MEASURED THAT RATHER THAN ASSUMING IT. My first
        version also gated `ownComplete` on the provenance, which READS like the fix and is inert: a
        defaulted card resolves to the built-in `complete = ["done"]`, and gating it to `[]` falls
        through to the literal `done` — the same verdict by a different route. Mutating the gate away
        left the suite green, which is how I found it. Shipping it would have been a conversion that
        scores as a win and changes nothing, so it is gone.

        The verdict SHOULD stay conservative here: this sweep WRITES merge evidence, and guessing a lane
        to rewrite history onto the wrong card is worse than leaving one unrepaired. What the provenance
        buys is the thing that was actually missing — the unresolvable card is now REPORTED instead of
        being indistinguishable from a card that answered, so "unrepaired" stops meaning "unrepairable
        and invisible forever".

   * Recover `in-review` tasks parked by a failed pre-merge workflow step.
   *
   * When a pre-merge workflow step (e.g. Browser Verification) fails during an
   * active executor run, the graph workflow records the failed step result and
   * the task ends up in `in-review` with that failed result still on record,
   * which `getTaskMergeBlocker` correctly treats as a merge block — leaving the
   * task stranded with no live session to un-stick it.
   *
   * This scan delegates back to the executor's `recoverFailedPreMergeWorkflowStep`
   * path (which reuses the same `sendTaskBackForFix` flow the executor uses
   * internally) so the agent gets another attempt with the failure feedback
   * injected into `PROMPT.md`. Bounded by `settings.maxPostReviewFixes` and the
   * per-task `postReviewFixCount` so a persistently-failing verifier cannot
   * ping-pong a task forever.
   *
   * Skips tasks not eligible for auto-merge processing (global `autoMerge`
   * off without an explicit per-task `autoMerge: true` override) — PR-based
   * review flow owns lifecycle until human merge.
   * @returns Number of tasks sent back for fix

      `listTasks({ column: "in-review" })` returns EMPTY on a renamed board, so `surfaceInReviewStalls`
      surfaced nothing: a card stalled in review past `taskStuckTimeoutMs` was never kicked back to the
      hold lane, and the operator saw a review column that silently stopped draining. Same shape as the
      twenty-odd siblings in this file, documented in
      `docs/solutions/architecture-patterns/self-healing-sweeps-are-blind-on-a-renamed-board.md`.

      Read via the project UNION and de-duplicate by id: a board mid-rename has rows under both the old
      and the new id, and over-inclusion costs one extra query whose rows the per-card guards below then
      filter. Under-inclusion is what was broken.

      `allowsAutoMergeProcessing` and `getInReviewStallReason` already gate every card individually, so
      no second lane test is needed here — the union only decides which rows are LOOKED at.

      Measured, not claimed: `lifecycle-column-census.mjs --json` reports `queryRoles.read` at 2 before
      this change and 1 after. I first wrote "the last one, 1 -> 0" and the tool said otherwise — one
      more read-shaped query survives elsewhere. Stating the number I actually saw rather than the one
      that would have read better, because a comment asserting a fact about the rest of the tree is the
      decay class this program has already had to correct twice.

  /*
  FNXC:WorkflowRecoveryPolicy 2026-07-27-23:20 (U4 — surfacing family retired onto the runner):
  These three were three copies of one skeleton. The mechanism they shared —
  pause gates, threshold resolution, the fresh-row skip, the at-most-once dedup,
  the log write, the never-throw contract — now lives in `runSurfacingSweep`, and
  each sweep is the part that was genuinely its own: which role it watches, which
  operator setting it inherits, who is eligible, and what it says.

  Thresholds are now POLICY-OVER-SETTING. A workflow that declares
  `recovery.stalenessMs` on the role's column wins; one that declares nothing
  keeps reading the operator setting exactly as before, so this migration changes
  nothing for an existing project and requires no workflow to be edited.

  Surfacing is OBSERVATIONAL, so per the re-ratified invariant it reports on
  user-paused cards — which is the entire point of the two paused sweeps.
  */
  /*
  FNXC:WorkflowRecoveryPolicy 2026-07-28-03:10 (PR #2487 review — shared cycle):
  ONE task snapshot and ONE workflow-IR cache shared across the three surfacing
  sweeps.

  Consolidating them onto a single runner made a pre-existing redundancy visible
  for the first time: each sweep issued its own unfiltered non-slim `listTasks`
  AND re-resolved every task's workflow from a fresh Map, and all three run
  back-to-back in both startup recovery and the maintenance batch. That is three
  full board reads and three IR resolutions per cycle where one of each suffices.

  WHY SHARING A SNAPSHOT IS SAFE HERE, and it is a property rather than a hope:
  the three sweeps PARTITION the task space, so no card is ever visible to two of
  them and none can observe staleness another introduced.

    surfaceStalePausedTodos    hold column   AND paused === true
    surfaceStalePausedReviews  review column AND paused === true
    surfaceInReviewStalled     review column AND paused !== true

  A card sits in exactly one column, so hold and review are exclusive; within
  review, `paused` splits the remaining two. `surfacing-family-shared.test.ts`
  asserts this partition directly, so a future sweep that widens its eligibility
  into another's territory fails rather than silently sharing a stale snapshot.

  The sweeps are read-mostly regardless: they append a task-log entry under their
  own distinct `logPrefix` and mutate no column or lifecycle field, and the
  at-most-once dedup matches on that prefix, so one sweep's entry is invisible to
  another's suppression check.

  idempotent `landWorkspaceTask`; already-landed repos are skipped via `isRepoLanded`). We do NOT
  call `landWorkspaceTask` directly. GUARDS (reuse, never reinvent): `allowsAutoMergeProcessing`
  (FN-5147 autoMerge:false), user-pause, and the WORKSPACE-AWARE liveness predicate
  (`isWorkspaceTaskLive`) — triple-proof is NOT workspace-aware so it is deliberately NOT used
  here. A live / paused / autoMerge-off task emits `task:reconcile-workspace-partial-land-no-action`
  and is NEVER moved backward.

  FORK-A (unrecoverable): a sub-repo is unrecoverable iff its `fusion/<id>` branch is GONE AND its
  `landedSha` is UNSET (nothing landed, nothing to land) → park the task `status:"failed"`. Branch
  gone but `landedSha` set → already landed (isRepoLanded ancestor/trailer) → that repo is skipped.
  Otherwise the task is retryable (re-enqueue).

      again on every subsequent pass.

      I wrote this sweep before that fix landed on the done-integrity one and reproduced its pre-fix
      shape verbatim. Same resolution, same reporting, so the two cannot drift.

      The VERDICT stays conservative: this sweep mutates a task's column and status, and guessing a lane

      A board that renames its review lane but declares NO lifecycle traits contributes nothing to this

      The three-state rule at PROJECT scope. Not fixed here because the safe direction differs by
      caller: over-inclusion is free for a sweep (the per-card check discards it) and inflates an
      operator-facing number in the analytics aggregators, so it needs an opt-in
      (`{ untraitedProject: "declared-columns" }`) on the shared helper rather than a change to what it
      returns by default.

      "fallback crosses workflow boundaries"): A CARD WHOSE BOARD CANNOT BE READ IS SKIPPED, NOT GUESSED.

      Two wrong answers were tried before this one, and both are worth recording because each looked
      correct in isolation:

        1. LEGACY IDS ONLY (original). Guarantees rejection for exactly the renamed cards the
           project-scoped query was widened to find — the sweep admits a card and then disowns it.
        2. THE PROJECT UNION (my first fix). Removes that, and crosses workflow boundaries: a column
           that carries a recovery role only in ANOTHER workflow starts admitting this card. This is an
           ACTION site — the verdicts below clear a contamination pause — and rule 3 of
           `project-union-versus-per-task-lanes.md` says over-inclusion is free for a read and costly
           for an action. I widened on an action site, which my own note says not to do.

      The honest third answer: without the card's board we cannot say whether its column carries the
      role, so we do not decide — EXCEPT where the card sits on a legacy id, which is deliberate and
      worth stating because it looks like an inconsistency (#2891 review, third round).

      A card in literal `in-review`/`in-progress` still passes, because the legacy seed above is not a
      guess: it is the documented degraded vocabulary, the same three-state answer used everywhere in
      this program when a board cannot be read. Skipping those would REGRESS every unconverted and
      legacy-id project — cards this sweep has always recovered would stop being recovered — to gain
      consistency with a case that only arises on renamed boards. The renamed card is the one we
      genuinely cannot classify, and it is the one that is skipped and reported. The card keeps the legacy ids seeded above — which is what it had
      before any of this — and is REPORTED, so a card the sweep cannot classify is visible instead of
      silently mis-decided in either direction. Same shape as the done-integrity sweep's unresolvable
      report: the fix for "cannot answer" is to say so, not to pick a side.

        rejects renamed lanes"): NARROW WHEN THE CARD CAN ANSWER, BROAD WHEN IT CANNOT.

        `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` does not fail — it SUBSTITUTES the built-in IR. So a card whose
        selection is missing or unreadable came back with `in-review`/`in-progress`, and the per-card
        verdicts below then REJECTED the very card the project-scoped query had just admitted from a
        renamed lane. The sweep found it and immediately disowned it.

        Provenance separates "this card's board says X" from "nobody could say, here is the default".
        Only the first is a per-card answer. When it is a substitution the card falls back to the
        PROJECT sets that admitted it — which is broader than its own board but is exactly the
        vocabulary this sweep already trusted to select it, and over-inclusion here costs at most a
        contamination check on a card that did not need one.

        The alternative — legacy ids only, as before — is the one shape that cannot be right: it
        guarantees rejection for precisely the renamed cards the query was widened to find.

          The TARGET is the dangerous one: `moveTask` REJECTS a column the workflow does not declare,

          the state other reconcilers exist to repair.

          `resolveTaskLifecycleColumns` is first-match per role: wrong for "is this card waiting",
          exactly right for "where should it land". Precedence hold -> intake -> legacy is the one
          `moves.ts:1296` documents, because a workflow may declare intake and no hold.

          Release worktree ownership only AFTER the fallible writes have committed.

          This sat here originally with its return DISCARDED, which let a refusal be
          followed by "Auto-recovered…", the audit and `recovered++` — reporting
          success while pulling a worktree from under a live planner, which is why it
          went unnoticed. My first correction hoisted the release ABOVE the writes so
          a refusal could abort cleanly, and that traded one fault for another: an
          `updateTask`/`moveTask` rejection after a SUCCESSFUL release left ownership
          given up with the task un-repaired and nothing owning the repair — the same
          torn-write shape U12 hit on re-home, irreversible step before fallible step.

          Both faults are fixed by splitting the question from the act: liveness is
          gated ABOVE via the read-only probe (so a live session never reaches these
          writes), and the irreversible release runs LAST, once the writes it depends
          on have landed. A throw before this point leaves ownership intact and the
          park in place for the next sweep.

          The refusal is still honored as defense-in-depth: reaching it means a
          session started between the probe and here, so ownership stays with that
          session. The un-park and requeue genuinely happened, so the recovery is
          still counted — the warning records only that the worktree was not released.

  FN-7884: Engine restart is an explicit operator retry boundary for durable heartbeat agents. Startup recovery must immediately clear recoverable `error` and `error-retry-exhausted` parks, reset shared heartbeatErrorRecovery/durableErrorRecovery budget state, and re-arm heartbeats without steady-state staleness/cooldown/exhaustion gates; operator-actionable, stale-module, user-paused, error-unrecoverable, disabled, ephemeral, and actively executing agents remain suppressed.

  FNXC:AgentHeartbeat 2026-07-14-16:13:
  Startup must also recover a `heartbeat-model-unavailable` park when its recorded failing provider differs from the agent's complete assigned runtime model. This repairs agents falsely parked by the former shared-project-model precedence while preserving genuine assigned-provider authentication failures for operator action.

  FNXC:AgentHeartbeat 2026-07-15-08:50:
  Startup now recovers every `heartbeat-model-unavailable` park (not only misattributed providers). Engine restart is treated like operator Retry: false model-unavailable/credential-probe parks clear immediately, and genuine missing credentials re-park on the next failing heartbeat.
