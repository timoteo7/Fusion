        Unwind EXACTLY what this attempt took. Two ways a naive `semaphore.release()` corrupts

        1. Compatibility shims without `tryAcquire` never acquire a slot and never get a reservation,
           so releasing returns capacity nobody held — `returnSlot` decrements `_active` and drains a
           waiter regardless. N decliners would free N phantom slots.
        2. `winner.reserve?.()` is `registerPreHeldExecutorSlot` for the triage and scheduler lanes.
           Releasing the semaphore without dropping that registration leaves the id in the global
           pre-held set with no backing acquire; the next pass's `takePreHeldExecutorSlot` then runs a
           full top-level session without acquiring a slot and releases one it never held, leaving
           `_active` permanently below the live agent count and the cap silently breached.
        `dropPreHeldExecutorSlot` performs releaseReservation + release itself, but no-ops when
        nothing was registered (the merge lane declines without reserving), so that case still needs

Deliberately still 600_000 after an attempt to lower it to 180_000 was reverted under review.
Motivation for the attempt: an operator-visible "Queued to plan" stall (FN-8600, 2026-07-26) lasted
~7 minutes, i.e. INSIDE this window, so the valve could not have fired even if leaked capacity was
the cause. Why it was reverted: nested runs -- the holders the original 600s was justified by -- are
already excluded from the reclaim floor (`reclaimFloor = bound + nestedActive`), so shortening the
window does not trade against them. What the window actually protects is a legitimate TOP-LEVEL
holder that `isRunningAgentTask` does not count: `runWithMergeAdmission` holds its slot for the whole
merge body (AI arbitration, post-merge audit, recovery dispatch, configured verification), including
the moments that park the row `paused`/`failed` or finalize it `done` -- all states that predicate
treats as not-running -- while neither lane's `inFlightCount` knows about a merge-lane slot. Inside a
shorter window the valve would reconcile that live slot away, `_drain()` would admit a replacement
over the cap, and the original body's later release would push `_active` permanently BELOW the true
live count (returnSlot clamps at 0 and never corrects upward) -- trading a bounded, visible stall for
an unbounded silent cap breach. Lower this only with measured evidence (the existing "recovered stale
semaphore active count X -> Y" warn gives the excess-duration distribution), or after merge-lane holds
are added to `inFlightCount` so a merge body can never look like leaked excess.

FNXC:GlobalConcurrencyControls 2026-07-16-00:00:
Generalized from the idle-only valve. The previous guard (`persistedActive !== 0
|| inFlightCount > 0` → reset) meant leaked slots were only ever reclaimed when
the WHOLE system quiesced. In production a handful of zombie in-progress rows
kept `persistedActive` nonzero indefinitely, so slots leaked by abnormal agent
teardown accumulated until `activeCount` pinned the limit — the engine then sat
fully idle ("Hold release … no reservable slot" on every sweep, planning=0,
processing=0, merge queue growing) until a process restart. The valve now
clamps `activeCount` down to the persisted+in-flight bound whenever the
semaphore over-holds CONTINUOUSLY for the repair window: the strict idle case
keeps its fast 5s window (same behavior as before), while the non-idle case
uses the conservative {@link STALE_SEMAPHORE_EXCESS_REPAIR_MS} so legitimate
nested-agent overshoot is never touched. `reconcileActiveCount` only lowers
the count, and the candidate timestamp resets the moment the excess clears.

  FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-14:30 (FLAGGED, NOT FIXED — the last raw caller of the running-agent predicate):
  `persistedTopLevelAgentSlots` takes RAW tasks, so `live-agent-count.ts`'s trait fields are undefined here
  and its predicates fall back to the legacy ids (`in-progress` for wip, `done`/`archived` for terminal).

  Traced every caller of that predicate before writing this: the live ADMISSION paths
  (`executor.ts` fn_spawn_agent, `project-engine.ts`) both use
  `computeTopLevelConcurrencyClaimedFromStore`, which enriches, and
  `workflow-agent-count-live-e2e.pg.test.ts` pins that number end to end. `computeTopLevelConcurrencyClaimed`
  (raw) has no production caller at all. THIS is the one live path left that does not enrich.

  CONSEQUENCE on a renamed board: cards in a renamed wip lane are not counted, so `persistedActive` and
  therefore `bound` are too low, and the continuous-excess timer below can see phantom excess and reclaim a
  semaphore slot that is legitimately held. That is the same class of harm the FN-7017 note directly below
  guards against for nested helper agents, arriving through the vocabulary door instead.

  NOT FIXED HERE, deliberately. `persistedTopLevelAgentSlotsFromStore` is the enriching variant and it is
  ASYNC; this is a synchronous leak-RECOVERY path, so adopting it changes the signature of a capacity repair
  routine whose failure mode is reclaiming live work. That is a behaviour change in the capacity subsystem,
  not a vocabulary conversion, and it wants an owner who can decide whether recovery should be able to await
  a store read at all — the alternative being to pass pre-enriched tasks in from the caller.

/**
 * A concurrency semaphore that gates all agentic activities (triage specification,
 * task execution, and merge operations) behind a shared slot limit.
 *
 * The semaphore ensures that the total number of concurrently running
 * **top-level** AI agents never exceeds `maxConcurrent`, regardless of which
 * subsystem spawned them. Nested helper agents (reviewers spawned from
 * inside a parent's tool call) are admitted via {@link runNested} without
 * entering the wait queue: they bump `activeCount` for honest observability
 * and respect the parent's slot, but can transiently push the count above
 * the configured limit. This is intentional — see {@link runNested} for the
 * fairness/deadlock rationale.
 *
 * **Priority-based draining:** When a slot becomes available and multiple agents
 * are waiting, the waiter with the highest `priority` value is served first.
 * Among waiters with the same priority, FIFO order is preserved. The built-in
 * priority constants are:
 *
 * - {@link PRIORITY_MERGE} (`2`) — merge agents (highest)
 * - {@link PRIORITY_EXECUTE} (`1`) — execution agents
 * - {@link PRIORITY_SPECIFY} (`0`) — specification/triage agents (lowest, default)
 *
 * The limit is read dynamically at `acquire()` time via a getter callback, so
 * live changes to `settings.maxConcurrent` take effect on the next acquire
 * without restarting the engine. Reducing the limit below the current
 * `activeCount` does not evict running agents — it simply blocks new acquires
 * until enough releases bring the active count below the new limit.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const sem = new AgentSemaphore(() => store.getSettings().then(s => s.maxConcurrent));
 * await sem.run(async () => {
 *   // at most maxConcurrent agents run this block concurrently
 * }, PRIORITY_EXECUTE);
 * ```
