FNXC:WorkflowGraphEntry 2026-07-26-17:10:
THE GRAPH ENTRY CONTRACT: a run with no durable continuation resumes at the card's OWN COLUMN, not
at `start`.

Post-cutover a node's column IS the card's lifecycle position, so replaying from `start` contradicted
that invariant: any run without a continuation (self-healing's graph re-entry, a fresh dispatch, an
operator drag into a processing column) re-entered at the first node of the FIRST column and dragged
the card backward through columns it had already left — firing `abort-on-exit` on its live session,
and stranding it in any pre-wip column that has no releaser. That backward drag is what previously
forced planning nodes to live in the implementation column.

The rule: enter at the first node, in pipeline order from `start`, whose column is not BEHIND the
card's current column (`ir.columns` is ordered, and that order is the lifecycle order). A card in the
planning lane still runs the planning prologue; a card already in implementation resumes at the first
implementation node instead of re-planning; a card in review re-enters at the first review node, so
review gates are never skipped.

Traversal follows the forward pipeline only — `rework` back-edges and failure edges are excluded — so
the entry point is the main path, never a remediation node that merely happens to sit in the column.

    (`workflow-graph-task-runner.ts`, `workflow-task-runtime.ts`) pass `ir` explicitly, so the default
    is unreachable in production — but `workflow-graph-executor-parity.test.ts` in the `engine-core`
    GATE suite drives this method without it, asserting the historical seam sequence. Switching to the

    `expected 'failure' to be 'success'`.

    I tried the change first and reverted it. The entry in
    `legacy-workflow-ir-callsite-allowlist.test.ts` records this so the next person does not repeat
    the experiment — the constant is the right answer HERE, which is the distinction that allow-list
