FNXC:WorkflowCustomNodes 2026-07-01-00:00:
Custom prompt/script/gate execution is exposed as a service boundary so graph runners and plugin hooks can depend on a typed node-execution service instead of a private TaskExecutor method. The service delegates during migration; later slices can move executor modes and approval/worktree guards behind this contract.

FNXC:WorkflowCustomNodes 2026-07-01-00:00:
The custom-node service must preserve graph context while abstracting executor internals because optional-group activation and workflow metadata are carried through the runner context, not only through task/settings inputs.
