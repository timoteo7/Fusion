 *   - APPROVE     → `value: "approve"`  (seam already marked the step done)
 *   - REVISE      → `value: "revise"`   (rework edge, no reset — revise in place)
 *   - RETHINK     → `value: "rethink"`  (rework edge whose traversal resets, U5 foreach)
 *   - UNAVAILABLE → bounded retry (cap {@link STEP_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE_RETRY_CAP});
 *                   still unavailable → `value: "unavailable"`
 *
 * The verdict + reworkCount are persisted via the foreach sub-walk: the handler
 * writes the latest verdict back onto the active context so the sub-walk's
 * `saveInstanceState` carries it into the instance row (KTD-6).
