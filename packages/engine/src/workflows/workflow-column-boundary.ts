FNXC:WorkflowColumnBoundary 2026-07-18-20:35:
U1 — the graph is the sole lifecycle driver. As traversal crosses from a node in
column A into a node in column B, the card MOVES to column B through the store's
trait-hook `moveTask` path. This controller is the seam the graph executor calls
on every real-node entry; it owns the trait decision (move vs. park), the audit
emission (KTD-12), and the durable IR pin / drift guard (KTD-3).

Rules encoded here:
  - KTD-1: `end` and failure-terminal arrivals never move — the executor never
    calls `onNodeEntry` for a node without a column, and failure edges in the
    benchmark terminate at `end` (columnless), so the card stays put and parks in
    place. Only column-bearing node entries move.
  - KTD-2: a hold→wip boundary is NEVER graph-moved. The graph parks the card at
    the ready-for-release seam and the scheduler's capacity sweep (U4) is the sole
    actor that performs the hold→wip move. This controller records the seam and
    performs no move on that boundary.
  - KTD-3: each node entry pins the resolved IR (version/content hash) durably on
    the run state; `detectDrift` compares the stored pin against the current IR at
    run start and parks with `task:reconcile-workflow-drift` on mismatch instead
    of traversing a mutated graph.
  - KTD-12: `task:column-transition` and `task:reconcile-workflow-drift` carry
    ids/counts/outcomes-only metadata — no prose, no model ids.

Idempotency (U1 scenario 4 — kill/restart mid-transition settles exactly once):
the controller tracks the card's current column and only moves when the entered
node's column differs. A re-entered node (rework loop) or a re-run after restart
in the same column is a no-op, so exactly one move + one audit event is produced
per real boundary crossing. The crash-safe `transitionPending` marker written
in-txn by `moveTaskInternal` is the store-level half of that guarantee.

FNXC:WorkflowIrPin 2026-07-19-18:30 (KTD-3 / U9b):
Store-backed KTD-3 pin persistence. The U9b schema landed the durable pin as three
task-row fields (`workflowIrPin` = content hash, `workflowIrPinNodeId`,
`workflowIrPinColumnId` — migration 0026), threaded through updateTask /
serialization / slim projections in core. This factory binds that row surface to
the boundary's `pinNodeEntry` / `loadPriorPin` seams:
  - pinNodeEntry writes via `updateTask` ONLY when the pin actually changed
    (same node re-entry / rework loops and same-hash chains are free — one row
    write per real node entry, not per traversal step);
  - loadPriorPin reads the fields back off the task row at run start so a
    restart/re-entry compares the crashed run's pin against the CURRENT IR and
    takes the drift-park path (`task:reconcile-workflow-drift`) on mismatch.
Degradation: a store lacking `updateTask`/`getTask`, or whose rows do not carry
the pin fields (in-memory fakes, pre-U9b DBs), yields no prior pin and no-op
writes — exactly the pre-wiring inert posture, so legacy harnesses are untouched.
