FNXC:CapacityModel 2026-07-29-15:00 (capacity-simplification audit — KEEP, with evidence):
Audited alongside the gridlock detector while collapsing the capacity model. It is
NOT a capacity component and nothing here changes with the limiters.

This detects a STUCK AGENT — a live session repeating the same tool call, or emitting
no activity signal — via tool fingerprints and inactivity windows. That is orthogonal
to how many agents are permitted to run: a single agent on an unlimited board can
still wedge.

Measured, not assumed: zero references to maxConcurrent / maxWorktrees / semaphore /
capacity / slot in this file. Live and wired (in-process-runtime.ts).
*/
/**
 * Stuck Task Detector — monitors in-progress tasks for agent session stagnation.
 *
 * The detector supports two detection modes:
 * - **Inactivity** — no activity at all for the timeout period (session appears dead)
 * - **Loop** — agent is active, has not advanced a step past the timeout, AND shows
 *   repetitive tool fingerprints or ignored step-update rebuffs (context-growth thrash).
 *   High activity volume alone is NOT a loop — long single-step work (E2E debug, refactors)
 *   produces many heartbeats without step transitions and must not false-positive.
 *
 * Activity tracking uses two signals:
 * - `recordActivity(taskId, signal?)` — text/tool heartbeats; increments `activitySinceProgress`.
 *   Tool calls should pass `{ toolName, toolDetail? }` so loop classification can fingerprint novelty.
 * - `recordProgress(taskId)` — step transitions (in-progress, done, skipped); resets counters
 *
 * The detector polls at a configurable interval and compares timestamps against
 * `taskStuckTimeoutMs` from settings. Project defaults keep this active by
 * default while keeping workflow-step execution timeouts independent.
