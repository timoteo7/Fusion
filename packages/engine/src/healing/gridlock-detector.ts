/*
FNXC:CapacityModel 2026-07-29-15:00 (capacity-simplification audit — KEEP, with evidence):
ASKED AND ANSWERED: does gridlock detection still have a job once capacity is two
numbers and the competing limiters are gone?

YES. "Gridlock" here has nothing to do with limiters arbitrating against each other.
`GridlockEvent.reasons` is typed `"dependency" | "overlap"` — it detects DEPENDENCY
deadlock and FILE-SCOPE OVERLAP deadlock, using `pathsOverlap` /
`filterPathsByIgnoreList` from the scheduler. Neither is affected by removing the
cross-project cap, the spawn budgets, or the worktree gate: two tasks can still
block each other on a dependency cycle or a shared file scope no matter how many
agents the operator allows.

Measured, not assumed: no CODE in this file references maxConcurrent, maxWorktrees, the shared
semaphore, or any slot/capacity accounting — the only occurrences of those words are in this note.
It is live and wired (project-engine.ts -> notifier.notifyGridlock).

Recorded here because the natural reading of the NAME is "limiters deadlocking", and
deleting a live detector on that reading would remove real coverage silently. If a
future cleanup revisits this, the question to ask is whether dependency and overlap
deadlock are still possible — not whether capacity is simpler.

    "Is this dependency satisfied?" resolved per DEPENDENCY, not per dependent: a blocker's OWN workflow
    decides when it stops blocking, and the two tasks need not share one.

    On a renamed board every one of these three comparisons was true for a finished blocker, so NO
    dependency ever counted as met — the detector then reports dependency gridlock for tasks that are
    not actually blocked, and `notifyGridlock` pages the operator about it.

    REVIEW COUNTS AS SATISFIED, deliberately, and via the SAME five flags the executor dependency gate
    uses — `review` is not a trait: the role is carried by mergeOrchestration/mergeBlocker/humanReview.
    Two gates answering "is this dependency satisfied?" differently is a split brain. A dependent may
    start once its blocker reaches review. Collapsing this to complete-only is the flattening that
    deadlocks a board, so the three roles stay a union rather than becoming `resolveLifecycleColumns`'s
    first-per-role.

    Unioned with the legacy review/completion pair because `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` returns the built-in IR for a missing
    or corrupt workflow rather than throwing; without the union a degraded board resolves a satisfied set
    that excludes its own terminal lanes and every dependency reads as unmet.
