Extracted helper of the unattended self-healing / scheduler sweeps, so its store writes carry
the same MARKER as the sweeps that call it: a timer-driven repair has no session, no request,
and no acting agent, and the only ids in scope name the SUBJECT of the write rather than its
author. Counted by `unattributed-actor-census.test.ts`; U13 owns whether these lanes get a real

(the classifiers are combined in chains) and every caller either holds a store or already resolved the lane.

These three decide whether a review row stranded by an unusable-worktree session start is RECOVERABLE. As
literals they answered NO on every renamed board, so the recovery never ran and the row stayed parked failed
for a human — the exact operator-action park these paths were written to avoid.

Optional, defaulting to the legacy id, so no existing caller or test changes behaviour.

 * FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-01:15 (PR #2736 review — greptile P1):
 * `isReviewColumn` is an optional RESOLVED answer; omitted, it is exactly today's behaviour.
 *
 * This predicate selects the SPECIALIZED retry that clears `worktree`/`branch`/`sessionFile`. Its
 * caller in `commands/task.ts` resolves the review lane from the task's workflow, so on a renamed
 * board the two classifiers disagreed: the generic in-review retry fired while this one did not, and
 * the generic branch leaves the stale session metadata in place — so the next execution hit the very
 * same missing-worktree failure. A retry that reports success and changes nothing.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-02:00 (note drift — the stated reason stopped being true):
 * The paragraph here used to say the parameter is optional "because the other caller (`extension.ts`)
 * still asks BOTH questions with the literal". That is no longer the case, and had it stayed it would
 * have told the next reader an unconverted caller exists — the kind of note that keeps an
 * inert-conversion shape alive by justifying it.
 *
 * Verified: ALL THREE production callers pass the resolved answer —
 * `cli/src/extension.ts`, `cli/src/commands/task.ts` and
 * `dashboard/src/routes/register-task-workflow-routes.ts`, each as
 * `retryReviewColumns.has(task.column)`.
 *
 * It stays optional anyway, for a reason that does not rot: the legacy fallback is DELIBERATELY
 * covered (`cli-active-count-lanes.test.ts` exercises the no-argument path on both a legacy and a
 * renamed lane). Making the parameter required would delete that coverage to buy an enforcement the
 * unwired-lane-parameter guard already provides — it watches `isReviewColumn` and fails the build if
 * any of those callers stops passing it.

    The note this replaces was right that the QUERY was the live filter and the `.filter` below it a
    redundant re-assertion — so converting the predicate alone would have dropped a census count and
    changed nothing an operator sees, because the board's wip rows were never listed.

    Fixing it needs a PROJECT-level answer: there is no task in hand before the read.
    `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles` unions every wip-bearing column any workflow declares with the
    legacy id, so a renamed board is swept and a board mid-rename still finds rows under the old one.

    THE REDUNDANT FILTER IS GONE rather than converted. Re-asserting the column the query just
    selected on adds nothing, and a second copy of the same rule is how a read and its filter drift —
    the `paused` check is the only thing that predicate contributed.

    The move DESTINATION below was already resolved (`resolveReboundTargetForTask`); its comment still
    described the pre-fix state and is corrected there. Naming all three layers because the previous
