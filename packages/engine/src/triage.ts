FNXC:PlanReviewReplan 2026-08-10-18:32 (TOMBSTONE — do not re-add):
`PLAN_REVIEW_GATE_REPLAN_CAP = 8` is DELETED. It belonged to the out-of-graph triage Plan Review gate
(`runPlanReviewBeforeExecution`, itself tombstoned in U10/R4), and it did not survive that deletion as
working code: nothing read it, and its companion counter `Task.planReviewReplanCount` was persisted,
serialized and reset but never incremented and never compared. A constant and a column that look like
a live safety ceiling while enforcing nothing are worse than no ceiling at all — they answer "is this
loop bounded?" with a confident yes.

The capability was NOT lost, only re-owned. U3 moved the cap-park into the graph, where
`requestPreMergeOptionalStepFix` enforces it against a per-step budget derived from the persisted
workflow-step results (`countPlanReviewRevisionAttempts`) rather than a task column:
  - an explicit finite budget (`planReviewMaxRevisions`, node `maxRevisions`) parks at `budget.max`;
  - the unbounded default is backstopped at `PLAN_REVIEW_FEEDBACK_HISTORY_LIMIT`;
both call `parkPlanReviewReplanCapExhausted`, which parks `awaiting-approval` with
`awaitingApprovalReason: "plan-review-replan-cap"` — the same reason string the dashboard badge,
detail banner and notifications already key on. That is the live owner; look there, not here.

Ratcheted by `packages/engine/src/__tests__/legacy-tombstones.test.ts`, which strips comments before
searching, so this note survives while the constant must not.

 *              pause, a deleted duplicate. A human or a later event owns the card;

 *   withheld — finalize could not complete the handoff. The card still holds a
 *              finished spec in the planner column and nothing is waiting on a
 *              human, so the CALLER'S retry budget is the correct owner.
 *

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-29-08:40 (U11 conversion — triage planner lanes):
The PLANNER LANES for a task: the columns where specification happens, resolved
from its own workflow.

Triage's eight column decisions are all one of two questions — "is this card in a
planner lane?" (hold or intake) and "where does a finished plan get released to?"
(hold) — and both were answered with literals. Under a renamed workflow every one
silently stops matching; after U11 deletes `todo` from the builtins, they stop
matching everywhere.

SYNCHRONOUS on purpose: several call sites are inside event listeners and pure
filter predicates, and introducing an `await` there would reorder handlers
relative to a synchronous emitter (see the scheduler conversion, where exactly
that broke five pre-existing tests).

Fail-soft to the legacy pair so an unresolvable or column-less workflow behaves
exactly as before.

NOTE FOR U11: once `triage` carries the capacity hold, `hold` and `intake` resolve
to the SAME column. Every `hold || intake` check below then collapses to one
column, and the release move becomes a no-op the guard already skips — which is
the intended end state, not a degenerate case.

MOVED to `replan-target.ts` (2026-07-30) so the executor's stranded-completed recovery and
planning-evacuation branches resolve the SAME lanes rather than growing a second copy. The
note above is kept here because this is where the eight decisions it describes live.

    the card, and an agent that keeps streaming tokens and writing a spec for it is doing work nobody

    This reuses the pause/delete abort machinery verbatim — same abort(), same token-usage snapshot,
    same `pauseAborted` unwind that clears status without reporting an error — so evacuation cannot
    drift from the two paths that already work.

    Moving the card BACK to todo/triage needs no new code: `taskColumnWakeHandler` above wakes the
    poll on that move, and with the planning status cleared the card is an ordinary planning
    candidate again, so planning restarts.

    Columns are matched positively (todo/triage) rather than naming "ideas", so evacuation to ANY

  PERIODIC counterpart to `clearStaleSpecifyingStatuses`, which runs at STARTUP ONLY.
  Observed strand (FN-8596): a plan-review REVISE routed to `plan-replan`, triage claimed the card
  with `status:"planning"` and ran the revision session, the session wrote the revised PROMPT.md and
  then died WITHOUT finalizing. The card was left in `triage` with `status:"planning"`, a live
  worktree, and no workflow continuation. Nothing re-dispatched it: triage rediscovery skips cards
  already marked `planning` (they look claimed), and the only sweep that clears that status ran at
  startup — so the card sat stranded until an operator restarted the engine. The leaked-slot reaper
  then reclaimed its concurrency slot, which made the card look idle without making it runnable.

  Clearing the status is the whole repair: the card is back in triage with a real spec, so ordinary
  rediscovery re-picks it on the next poll. This does NOT move, pause, or fail the card.

  Two guards keep it from racing a healthy planner:
    - `this.processing` excludes sessions this process owns.
    - a staleness floor excludes cards touched recently, which covers planners owned by ANOTHER
      node/process that this process's `processing` set cannot see.
  User-paused cards are never touched (an operator park is authoritative).

    wants every column that plays these roles anywhere in the project. `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles`
    is that resolver, already used for the same purpose in `self-healing.ts`.

    The legacy pair stays in the union deliberately — the note above explains why (`triage` and `todo`
    must both be swept for pre-U11 and Coding (Ideas) rows), and querying extra columns is free here
    because the sweep only READS and every row is filtered on `status === "planning"` first.

      with free concurrency slots and NO explanation in either diagnostic — no "Plan throttled by"
      log line and no `task:plan-admission-throttled` run-audit row.

      Cause: `coordinatorAdmittedTaskIds` was only cleared by specifyTask's `finally` (and its
      duplicate-claim guard), so a promise that never settles — exactly the case this eviction
      exists for — left the id in the set permanently. Planning discovery does not consult that
      set, so the card stayed in `triageTasks` and `maxToStart` stayed positive, which means the
      throttle branch (the only thing that logs or emits) never fired; but `admitNext`'s
      `refresh()` filters on the set, so the coordinator saw no candidate. Silent stall until
      engine restart, and the badge (a pure client-side "unplanned + idle in Todo" inference) kept
      claiming the card was queued.

      The pre-held host slot is the second claim on the same path. A promise hung INSIDE
      retryableWork has already transferred ownership, so the drop is a no-op there by design; a
      promise hung BEFORE `takePreHeldExecutorSlot` still holds an untransferred registration, and
      returning it here is the difference between a reclaimed slot and one the semaphore's
      stale-excess valve cannot touch for 600s. If such a run later resumes, its take() returns
      false and it acquires through `semaphore.run` normally, so the register/take-or-drop pairing

    Planning discovery has TWO admission rules, and they were selected by hardcoded column id:
    `triage` admitted any card still in the planning stage, `todo` admitted only a card whose
    PROMPT.md still reads as a seed (a planned card in the hold column is waiting for CAPACITY,
    not for planning, and re-specifying it would discard its approved spec).

    Both now select by TRAIT, so a workflow that renames or merges its pre-implementation columns
    keeps both rules. Deleting `triage` from the coding IRs — U11 — would otherwise leave the
    intake rule matching nothing while the hold rule silently became the only one.

    ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Under U11 one column carries BOTH `intake` and `hold`, so a card can
    satisfy both rules. Hold is tested FIRST and the branches are mutually exclusive, for two
    reasons: a card would otherwise appear in both lists and be dispatched twice for the same
    planning run, and the hold rule is the NARROWER of the two — applying the intake rule to a
    merged column would re-specify a card that has already been planned and is only waiting for a
    slot. Narrower wins; nothing is admitted that both rules would not admit.

    A card whose workflow cannot be resolved falls back to the legacy ids rather than being
    dropped from discovery entirely — an unplannable card is worse than a conservatively
    planned one, and R11 keeps `todo`/`triage` legal ids for stored rows and custom workflows.

    FNXC:MergedPlanningColumn 2026-07-29-09:20 (PR #2515 review — greptile + coderabbit):
    COST. Resolving a task's lifecycle columns needs its workflow-selection row, i.e. a store
    round-trip. The first cut of this conversion awaited one for EVERY task on the board,
    sequentially, before filtering anything — turning a pure in-memory filter into an O(board)
    serial scan on the triage poll, which is the engine's hottest loop. It scaled with total board
    size instead of with candidate count, so it was worst for exactly the operators with the
    biggest boards.

    Two changes, in order of importance:

    1. FILTER FIRST. Every predicate that needs no store read — processing/live-planning
       membership, pause, the terminal statuses, the recovery backoff, and each branch's own cheap
       precondition — is applied BEFORE any resolution. Only survivors are resolved, so the cost is
       O(candidates), and a board whose cards are overwhelmingly done/in-review/executing pays
       almost nothing.
    2. Resolve the survivors CONCURRENTLY under a bounded window rather than one await at a time,
       so a genuine backlog of candidates costs one bounded batch instead of N serial round-trips.
       Bounded rather than an unbounded Promise.all: this runs against the operator's live database
       and a board-sized fan-out is its own denial of service.

    The IR cache still collapses the parse cost — a board of 400 cards on three workflows reads
    three IRs — and is now shared across the concurrent resolutions rather than a serial loop.

    A MANUAL intake (`autoTriage: false`) is never auto-admitted. Coding (Ideas) exists so an operator
    can park a card without the engine planning it; the operator promotes it into Planning when ready.

    HOW IT BROKE. The rule used to be enforced accidentally, by this predicate naming `triage`: an
    `ideas` card matched no branch. Converting the predicate to resolve intake BY TRAIT made `ideas`
    the resolved intake column for that workflow — so discovery started specifying parked ideas. The
    conversion widened admission, which is the same shape as every other half-conversion in this
    program: the guard became correct in vocabulary and wrong in effect.

    ITS GUARDING TEST COULD NOT CATCH IT. `triage.test.ts`'s "excludes a parked ideas-column task"
    uses a mock store with no workflow readers, so lifecycle resolution falls back to
    `triage`/`todo` and an `ideas` card matches neither branch — it passes for a reason unrelated to
    the rule, and kept passing after the rule broke. Its own comment still describes the old
    mechanism ("which only matches column === triage"), which is the tell.

    The hold branch is deliberately NOT gated on this: a card in the hold column was RELEASED there,

    FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-29-18:40 (U11 — STALL 3):
    A card in a column its OWN workflow does not declare is unowned by construction:
    no lane's rules apply to it, so no sweep claims it.

    #2515 created a population of exactly these. It removed `triage` from the default
    lineage while leaving the id legal for stored rows, and shipped no migration — so
    every project upgrading has cards sitting in a column their workflow no longer
    knows about. Both role checks above miss them (a default card's `intake` and
    `hold` are BOTH `todo`), and the rebound paths that could move them are all
    triggered by ACTIVE work, which a parked card has none of. Discovery admitted
    nothing and the card sat until an operator dragged it by hand.

    Admitting it to PLANNING heals it without a data migration: it gets planned, and
    finalize releases it to the workflow's hold column, re-homing the row as a side
    effect of ordinary work.

    An EMPTY declared set means the IR could not be resolved (or is column-less v1) —
    that is ignorance, not evidence of strandedness, so it must never trigger the
    rescue. Requiring a non-empty set keeps an unresolvable workflow behaving exactly
    as before.

    NARROWED to the LEGACY LIFECYCLE IDS, and this is the load-bearing half. "Any
    undeclared column" is too broad: a card can also sit in a column its workflow
    genuinely owns while the SELECTION fails to resolve, and then the resolved
    default IR does not declare that column either. The first version of this rescue
    re-specified a parked Coding (Ideas) `ideas` card for exactly that reason, which
    breaks FN-7596's manual-intake rule — an ideas card is promoted by an OPERATOR,
    never auto-planned. `triage.test.ts` caught it.

    So the rescue is scoped to the population a lineage change can actually strand: a
    card resting on a legacy PRE-IMPLEMENTATION id that its own workflow no longer
    declares. A workflow-specific column name is never rescued, which is the
    difference between healing #2515's orphans and second-guessing a workflow about
    its own board.

        it was UNANSWERABLE after the fact — the binding gate existed only in this `planLog.log`,

        exhausted" from "project cap consumed". Emitting the gate to run-audit makes it answerable at
        all. Caveat: today the only run-audit READ route resolves through a durable agent's heartbeat
        run, and this event carries a synthetic run id under agentId "triage", so it is reachable by
        direct DB query but not yet through any dashboard route or fn_* tool -- the same blind spot
        every synthetic-run self-healing/scheduler diagnostic shares. A task/type-scoped run-audit
        read surface would close it for all of them at once.

        Metadata stays ids/counts/outcomes-only per the run-audit contract: gate name, caps, counts,
        and at most five eligible/processing task IDs — never prompts, titles, or reasons prose.

        Deduped on the gate signature, not on time: while the gate and the cards behind it hold
        steady a long stall collapses to ONE row instead of ~28 at a 15s poll, which is what keeps
        operators reading the event. The signature deliberately includes the eligible task IDs --
        counts alone would let a NEW card's stall be swallowed whenever the numbers happened to land
        on the same tuple, and "why is THIS card queued" is the question the event exists to answer.
        Live counts still jitter as unrelated lanes cycle, so this bounds write volume rather than

          Hard ceiling on the planning turn. Fusion previously set NO timeout here, and the only
          inherited one is the provider SDK's `APIConnectionTimeoutError` (300s) which caps
          TIME-TO-FIRST-BYTE only — it is cleared as soon as response headers arrive, after which the
          stream is uncapped. `configureHttpDispatcher` (which would install undici body/headers idle
          timeouts) is only called from pi's own CLI entrypoints, never in the in-process engine, so
          there was no idle timeout either. Measured consequence: single planning attempts ran to 126
          minutes, and failed-attempt durations showed a smooth 1-126 min spread with no clustering —
          the signature of nothing enforcing a bound.

          The stuck detector does not cover this: `recordActivity` fires on every streamed token, so a
          session that emits anything between provider stalls never trips its inactivity threshold.

          Default is deliberately GENEROUS (90 min) rather than tight. Successful planning work items
          measured over 7 days: p50 12.7 min, p90 39.5 min, p99 105.7 min. A tight ceiling would abort
          legitimate long plans and pay for the restart, which is the churn this work is removing. The
          ceiling exists to make a HUNG turn terminate at all, not to discipline slow ones. A timeout
          here is recoverable, not fatal: it surfaces as a transient error and consumes one attempt of
          the bounded planning budget below.

        UNCLASSIFIED planning failures are bounded. This branch is the catch-all for every error the
        classifiers above did not recognize, and it used to restore the card's claimable status and
        write NOTHING else — no counter, no `nextRecoveryAt`, no park. Triage rediscovery therefore
        re-admitted the card on the very next poll, forever, and `replaceActiveTaskWorkflowContinuation`
        replaced the terminal work item with a fresh one carrying no attempt count, so nothing anywhere
        recorded that the task had already failed N times.

        Measured cost of that hole: `"Request timed out."` (unrecognized until the companion fix to
        `transient-error-patterns.ts`) produced 48 failures across 10 tasks in 30 hours with zero
        backoff — FN-8950 burned 8 consecutive attempts over ~8 hours and never reached implementation.
        Classifying that ONE string fixes that ONE symptom; this budget is what makes the NEXT
        unrecognized error string fail safely instead of looping for a day.

        Deliberately reuses the `recoveryRetryCount`/`nextRecoveryAt` pair (and its 60s/120s/300s
        jittered backoff) that the transient branch above already uses, rather than adding a parallel
        counter: the budget answers "this task keeps failing to plan", which is true regardless of
        which classifier recognized the error, and sharing it avoids a schema migration for a counter
        that means the same thing. On exhaustion the card is parked `failed` for a human — unlike a
        transient exhaustion, an unrecognized error has no evidence it is retryable at all.

## Revision Instructions
You are revising an existing task specification based on Plan Review or user feedback.

**Converge — do not rewrite from scratch.**
- Keep the same overall PROMPT.md structure (headings, sections, format) unless the feedback explicitly requires a fundamental rethink (RETHINK).
- Apply **surgical** edits that fully resolve every blocking issue in the revision feedback below.
- Preserve wording, steps, file scope, and acceptance criteria the feedback does not criticize.
- Do not expand scope, invent new deliverables, or churn File Scope to "improve" an otherwise approved plan.
- Treat every item in the cumulative ledger as a durable review decision unless a later entry explicitly supersedes it. Preserve resolved items, address every unresolved item, and do not regress an earlier correction while fixing the latest feedback.
- After editing, rerun the full Mandatory Planning Completeness Procedure against the entire revised specification — not only the latest feedback — so a subsequent Plan Review can evaluate all remaining blockers in one pass.

  } else if (isFreshRespecification) {
    revisionSection = `

## Re-specification Instructions
You are creating a fresh replacement specification based on Plan Review or user feedback (no usable prior PROMPT.md draft is available).

**Important:** Treat the current task title and description as required primary inputs, inspect the codebase, and write a complete new specification that addresses the feedback below. Do not invent requirements beyond the feedback and task description.

## Subtask Breakdown Requested
The user has requested that this task be broken into smaller subtasks if it is complex enough to warrant splitting.

**When to split:**
- Only split when the work is meaningfully decomposable into 2-5 independently executable child tasks
- Each child task should be completable on its own with a clear scope and acceptance criteria
- Child tasks should have logical dependencies between them if order matters

**How to split:**
1. First, analyze the task to determine if it should be split
2. If splitting: use the \\\`fn_task_create\\\` tool to create child tasks in order, setting up dependencies as needed
3. Include clear descriptions and acceptance criteria for each child task
4. After creating all subtasks, stop — do NOT write a PROMPT.md for the parent task
5. If NOT splitting: proceed with a normal PROMPT.md specification for this task

**Subtask dependencies rule:** \`dependencies\` on a child may only reference **sibling subtasks created earlier in this same split** or **pre-existing tasks in the store**. They must NEVER reference the parent task being split — the parent is deleted after the split completes, and a dependency on a deleted task permanently blocks the dependent. If a child "needs the rest of the parent's work to finish first", create another sibling subtask for that remaining work and depend on the sibling. The \`fn_task_create\` tool rejects parent-id dependencies.

**Important:** If you create subtasks, this parent task will be closed and replaced by the children. Make sure each child is a complete, executable task.`;
  } else {
    subtaskSection = `

## Subtask Consideration
The user did not explicitly request subtask breakdown. Default to keeping the task whole; only split when the work is genuinely large or has clearly independent deliverables.

**Split into 2-5 child tasks when ANY of these apply:**
- The task will require MORE THAN 7 implementation steps
- The task affects MORE THAN 3 different packages/modules with distinct concerns (touching multiple packages as a coherent vertical change does NOT count — e.g. types + store + UI + tests for one feature is one task)
- Any single step would take more than 1-2 hours to complete
- The task has multiple clearly independent deliverables that could be developed and shipped in parallel by different people

**GOOD TO SPLIT:**
- A task that would require 12+ implementation steps spanning genuinely separate concerns
- A multi-feature epic where each feature can be shipped independently
- A refactor that has both a "rip out the old" phase and an "add the new" phase that can land separately

**NOT NECESSARY TO SPLIT (and SHOULD NOT be split):**
- A bug fix with clear scope, regardless of how many files it touches
- A single-file refactor
- A vertical feature that touches core + dashboard + tests as one coherent unit (this is the common case in this monorepo — keep it together)
- Any task with 10 or fewer focused steps within a coherent scope

**How to decide:**
- If you choose to split: use the \\\`fn_task_create\\\` tool to create the child tasks, set dependencies where needed, and then stop without writing a PROMPT.md for the parent task.
- **Subtask dependencies must only reference sibling subtasks created earlier in this same split, or pre-existing tasks. NEVER depend on the parent task being split — the parent is deleted after splitting, and the tool will reject parent-id dependencies.**
- When in doubt, do NOT split. Coordination overhead (worktrees, dependency wiring, merge sequencing) is real — splitting must clearly pay for itself.
- If size is uncertain at first, make a quick assessment from the available context before deciding.`;
