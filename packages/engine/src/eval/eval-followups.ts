FNXC:Evals 2026-07-26-00:00:
Eval follow-ups are a real product feature, but they used to borrow the shared automated-recovery follow-up engine (`createAutomatedFollowup` in verification-followup-dedup.ts) purely for its dedup pass. That engine was deleted along with the recovery follow-up cards it existed to file, so the one dedup rule this feature actually needs is inlined here: never create a second card for the same `suggestionId` under the same parent while one is still open. Closed columns (done/archived) are excluded so a re-run after the follow-up is finished can legitimately file a fresh card.
*/
/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-19:10 (the dedup blocked new follow-ups forever on a renamed board):
The comment above states the intent exactly — "closed columns (done/archived) are excluded so a re-run
after the follow-up is finished can legitimately file a fresh card". Keyed on the literal pair, a finished
follow-up in a RENAMED complete lane still read as OPEN, so the dedup matched it forever and the fresh card
was never filed. The feature silently stopped working on any board that renamed its terminals.

Resolved per candidate through the shared `resolveTerminalColumnsFor`, which unions the task's real
terminals with the legacy pair — see its note: a missing custom workflow silently yields the BUILT-IN IR,
so the union is what keeps a renamed board's own terminal recognised.

  FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-06:40 (engine feed):
  "Open" is the negation of the task's OWN terminal lanes, not a hard-coded list of four ids.

  Census-invisible: `OPEN_COLUMNS` is a `Set` literal — a definition, not a comparison — so nothing
  in the lifecycle backlog pointed here. Found by grepping for lane-shaped list literals.

  Consequence on a renamed board: the set matched NOTHING, so `openTasks` was empty and the
  dedupe below had no live work to compare against. Every eval run then re-filed follow-ups it had
  already filed — the failure is DUPLICATE TASK CREATION, which looks like the evaluator being
  thorough rather than like a bug.

  Uses `resolveTerminalColumnsFor` — ALREADY IMPORTED IN THIS FILE for the candidate loop below, and
  the same helper the executor uses. It unions the task's resolved terminals with the legacy pair for
  the degraded-IR reason documented at its definition, so there is no fallback to hand-write here.

  My first draft manufactured synthetic trait flags from lane equality to call `isTerminalColumnRole`
  instead. That is the anti-pattern I flagged in `task-update.ts` two commits ago — a longer way to
  write the same comparison while LOOKING like it consulted the trait registry — and it ignored a
  correct helper sitting three lines above the import. Replaced before commit.
