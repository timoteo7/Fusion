FNXC:WorktreeBaseRefresh 2026-08-01-16:04:
Planning deliberately creates an isolated task worktree, but execution may begin after dependencies land.
Only refresh-enabled execution reuse reaches this primitive: planning, review, gates, and merge retain their
existing worktrees. It resolves integration C1 independently on every reuse and aligns durable baseCommitSha
to C1; a rebased own-commit HEAD C2 is preserved and is never stored as the baseline. Git mutations are
compensated back to C0 when baseline persistence fails; a later process can statelessly reconcile C0 versus
clean C1/C2 from durable metadata and git proof alone.

FNXC:WorktreeBaseRefresh 2026-08-09-23:49:
Refreshing the base is an OPTIMIZATION (start on landed dependency commits), never a correctness gate — so it
must never block execution. The original design refused dirty/conflicting/unresolvable states with
`executionSafe: false`, and every such refusal reached the executor's terminal sink: 99 tasks were parked
`failed` and paged the operator between 2026-08-01 and 2026-08-09 (74 dirty-worktree, 25 stale-base-conflict),
while the bounded non-parking lane built for them fired 0 times. 82 of the 99 landed within five minutes of
"Task marked done by agent" — they were code-review-remediation re-entries into `execute()` on the task's own
warm worktree, i.e. exactly the checkout the refresh must leave alone.

`executionSafe` now means "the tree is at a known-good commit with the session's work intact", not "the base is
current". Every outcome that leaves the tree provably at C0/C1/C2 is safe and execution proceeds on whatever
base it has; only an UNPROVEN tree (compensation failed, so a half-rebased checkout may be on disk) still
blocks, because running an agent there would corrupt real work. This matches the policy already used when a
FRESH worktree cannot rebase onto origin/main: keep the local base and let the merge-time rebase retry with
conflict resolution — the merge lane owns conflict arbitration and deliberately leaves `refreshStaleBase` off
(see merger.ts). Dispatch-time rebase had no conflict resolution at all, so it could only ever fail.
