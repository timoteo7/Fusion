FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2 — why every store mutation in this file carries the MARKER):
The scheduler dispatches and re-blocks cards on a poll loop. Its writes are unattended system
bookkeeping with no session, no request, and no acting agent — the agent ids in scope name the task's
ASSIGNEE, i.e. the subject of the write, never its author. Deriving from those would produce audit
rows claiming an agent blocked or unblocked itself. The marker records the truth (no actor resolved
yet) and is counted by `unattributed-actor-census.test.ts`, so U13 inherits an explicit work list.
Do NOT substitute a system-actor identity here: whether these lanes get one is U13's decision.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-19:05 (fleet — scheduler dependency satisfaction):
A dependency's satisfaction is decided on ITS OWN board, because a dependency edge may cross
workflows: the dependent can sit on the default board while the dependency lives on a renamed one.

THE TWO RULES THIS FILE ALREADY HAD, PRESERVED EXACTLY:
  legacy (live)   satisfied = COMPLETE or ARCHIVED or the REVIEW lane (mergeBlocker/humanReview)
  marker (shadow) satisfied = COMPLETE or ARCHIVED, else the handoff marker decides

They genuinely differ on the review lane, and the conversion does NOT reconcile them — that is a
product decision, not a vocabulary one. See the PR body: #2720 settled "satisfied = complete or
archived" for `update-task-deps.ts`, which matches the MARKER rule, so the live legacy rule here is
the broader of the two. Narrowing it silently would strand every dependent of an in-review card.

`columns` is resolved per dependency and passed in by the caller. Omitted (or absent for a given
dependency) → the legacy literals, i.e. exactly today's behaviour, so no unconverted call site
changes meaning and an unresolvable workflow fails soft rather than reading as unsatisfied forever.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-28-11:35 (U11 conversion):
A task's HOLD and INTAKE columns, resolved from its own workflow.

The scheduler's event handlers all ask a variant of "is this the backlog?" and
answered it with the literal `"todo"`. That silently stops matching for a renamed
workflow, and stops matching for EVERY workflow once U11 deletes `todo` from the
builtins. Most of these failures are LATENCY rather than incorrectness — a wake
that does not fire costs up to one poll interval — which is precisely why they
would go unnoticed.

Resolution is per task because a board spans workflows. Cost matches existing
practice in this file, which already resolves per task at the dispatch-diagnostic
and worktree-capacity sites; these handlers fire per move/update event, not per
card in a sweep.

Fail-soft to the legacy pair: an unresolvable workflow behaves exactly as before
this conversion rather than losing the wake entirely.

      The settle-window ledger (`recentEngineTodoRequeues`) and the dispatch-oscillation reset are
      CONSUMED SYNCHRONOUSLY, so they must stay in the emitter tick with the rest of the synchronous
      prologue — reading the sync, emitter-lane-aware `parked`, never the async `resolvedParked`.
      FN-8656 moved these two arms behind `await resolveTaskParkedColumns` while converting lane
      lookups; that broke the ordering against the synchronous `task:deleted`/`task:updated`
      handlers, which also mutate `recentEngineTodoRequeues`/oscillation state. Concretely: a card
      requeued to hold then deleted in the same tick had its settle-window SET run a microtask AFTER
      the delete's synchronous CLEAR, so the guard survived deletion and the card never re-dispatched
      (todo-inprogress-flapping.test.ts "clears the settle-window guard when the task is deleted" and
      "resets dispatch oscillation state on forward transition to in-review"). This obeys FN-8656's
      own stated rule: convert to the async resolver ONLY where the answer is consumed asynchronously.
      Production emitters carry lanes, so `parked` resolves renamed hold/wip/review columns here too;
      the lane-less SQLite polling emitters retain the legacy fallback exactly as before.

      failed/awaiting-approval park does not trigger a pointless pass, and on column so a card

    every blocker and the warning below reported a long-standing bottleneck as `temporary` forever.
    The fan-out COUNT was correct throughout, which is what makes it quiet: the message names a real
    problem and mis-states its age.

    FLAT SET, DELIBERATELY, and the limit is worth naming: `escalationColumns` is board-wide, so on a
    board spanning workflows this unions every workflow's active lanes. An id one workflow calls wip
    and another calls something else is therefore treated as active for both. That over-approximates
    in the CHEAP direction here — the cost is a bottleneck warning reading `long-lived` slightly too
    eagerly, never a missed one — and it matches how `terminalColumns`/`reviewColumns` are already
    passed in this file. A per-task answer would need the `classify`-shaped option this module
