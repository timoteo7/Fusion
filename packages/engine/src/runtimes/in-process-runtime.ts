  EVERY due `kind: "task"` continuation is this drain's work, whatever its `waitReason`. This used to
  skip anything but `waitReason: "planning"` as "belonging to a different drain" — but no such drain
  exists. `listDueWorkflowWorkItems` has exactly two callers: this pass, and the self-healing reclaim
  sweep, which deliberately refuses to touch `runnable`/`retrying` rows because they are "the
  dispatcher's own queue" (`workflows/stranded-continuation-reclaim.ts`). So a runnable non-planning
  row was owned by nobody: skipped here every ~2s poll with no state change and no audit row, and
  passed over there by design. Silent, permanent, and invisible — the board simply looks idle.

  Observed on the Fusion board 2026-08-11: eight cards (FN-8901/8902/8953/8955/8956/8958/8987/8988)
  sat runnable for up to 8h while the engine was unpaused with 0 tasks in progress and 4 of 10
  worktrees used. Three carried `waitReason: "capacity"` (written by the capacity-suspend path in
  `workflow-column-boundary-hooks.ts` — the graph correctly parks a card when the board is full, and
  nothing ever resumed it once capacity freed); five carried a NULL reason. The 09:04 reclaim sweep
  had just moved them `held -> runnable`, which HANDED them to this drain and simultaneously put them
  out of the sweep's own reach — so the auto-resume fix made the strand tighter than the wedge it
  repaired.

  Dispatch is node-agnostic (`executor.execute(task)` re-enters the durable graph at the card's own
  node) and admission-gated by `admitPlanningContinuation`, which re-checks the real live-task cap.
  A capacity-parked row therefore resumes only when a slot is genuinely free — accepting it here
  cannot reintroduce the over-cap dispatch the suspend exists to prevent.

 * means the card crossed into the hold column (or was already resting there) and is
 * the graph's now. `parked` belongs to a human, `withheld` belongs to the caller's
 * retry budget — arming a run for either is doing work nobody asked for.

/**
 * InProcessRuntime runs a project within the main process.
 *
 * This is the default execution mode — all components (TaskStore, Scheduler,
 * Executor, WorktreePool) share the same memory space and event loop.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Direct access to TaskStore and Scheduler via getter methods
 * - Synchronous event forwarding from TaskStore to runtime listeners
 * - Graceful shutdown with configurable timeout
 * - Automatic orphaned task recovery on startup
 *
 * Lifecycle boundary:
 * - Mesh networking services (PeerExchangeService + mDNS discovery) are process-level
 *   concerns owned by CLI startup paths (`runServe`/`runDashboard`) because discovery
 *   requires the final bound HTTP port. InProcessRuntime remains project-scoped and
 *   intentionally does not start process-level mesh services.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const config: ProjectRuntimeConfig = {
 *   projectId: "proj_abc123",
 *   workingDirectory: "/path/to/project",
 *   isolationMode: "in-process",
 *   maxConcurrent: 2,
 *   maxWorktrees: 4,
 * };
 *
 * const runtime = new InProcessRuntime(config, centralCore);
 * await runtime.start();
 *
 * // Access components directly
 * const taskStore = runtime.getTaskStore();
 * const scheduler = runtime.getScheduler();
 *
 * await runtime.stop();
 * ```
