  EVERY due `kind: "task"` continuation is this drain's work, whatever its `waitReason`. This used to
  skip anything but `waitReason: "planning"` as "belonging to a different drain" — but no such drain
  exists. `listDueWorkflowWorkItems` has exactly two callers: this pass, and the self-healing reclaim
  sweep, which deliberately refuses to touch `runnable`/`retrying` rows because they are "the
  dispatcher's own queue" (`workflows/stranded-continuation-reclaim.ts`). So a runnable non-planning
  row was owned by nobody: skipped here every ~2s poll with no state change and no audit row, and
  passed over there by design. Silent, permanent, and invisible — the board simply looks idle.

  Observed on the Fusion board 2026-08-11: eight cards (FN-8901/8902/8953/8955/8956/8958/8987/8988)
  sat runnable for up to 8h while the engine was unpaused with 0 tasks in progress and 4 of 10
  worktrees used. Three carried `waitReason: "capacity"` (written by the capacity-suspend path in
  `workflow-column-boundary-hooks.ts` — the graph correctly parks a card when the board is full, and
  nothing ever resumed it once capacity freed); five carried a NULL reason. The 09:04 reclaim sweep
  had just moved them `held -> runnable`, which HANDED them to this drain and simultaneously put them
  out of the sweep's own reach — so the auto-resume fix made the strand tighter than the wedge it
  repaired.

  Dispatch is node-agnostic (`executor.execute(task)` re-enters the durable graph at the card's own
  node) and admission-gated by `admitPlanningContinuation`, which re-checks the real live-task cap.
  A capacity-parked row therefore resumes only when a slot is genuinely free — accepting it here
  cannot reintroduce the over-cap dispatch the suspend exists to prevent.

FN-519 — release a `planner-live` continuation deferral once the planner that CAUSED it is gone.

The Plan Review continuation is legitimately seeded before `specifyTask`'s finally removes the task
from the planning-owner set, so the drain correctly meets `planner-live` and pushes `retryAfter`
out by PLANNER_LIVE_CONTINUATION_DEFER_MS. Nothing lifted that deferral when the planner actually
finished, and a bare wake cannot help because the row has left the due window — that is the single
seconds-scale wait behind "planning finished but the review did not start".

Same shape and same guarantees as `wakeApprovedPlanningContinuations`, which serves the operator's
approval decision; both are kept separate because they answer different causes and the caller in
each case knows which one disappeared. The write is a compare-and-set on the observed state, so it
cannot resurrect a terminal row or steal a `running` claim from another node. Fail-soft: inspection
or CAS failure warns and falls back to the existing deadline, and the consumer is kicked either way
so the normal classifier stays authoritative.

 * gate — finalize writes `status: "awaiting-approval"` and RETURNS EARLY, before the

 * for a plan the operator had not approved. PR #2491 stopped the seeder from acting
 * on that, defensively, at the seeder. This removes the reason it was ever asked.
 *
 * `released` is the ONLY outcome that licenses arming a run: it is the only one that
 * means the card crossed into the hold column (or was already resting there) and is
 * the graph's now. `parked` belongs to a human, `withheld` belongs to the caller's
 * retry budget — arming a run for either is doing work nobody asked for.
 *
 * The log line reports the real outcome rather than asserting a move that may not
 * have happened; an operator reading "Specified → todo" for a card sitting in the
 * planner column is being told something false about their own board.
 *
 * EXTRACTED from the inline `onSpecifyComplete` callback for the same reason the
 * continuation drain was in PR #2491: the callback is constructed inside

FNXC:HumanMergeApproval 2026-09-17-22:32:
FN-514 P0 remediation — the RELEASE owner for a parked delivery hold.

The graph barrier parks a `held` continuation when a card is waiting for an operator, and the
continuation drain only claims `runnable`/`retrying` rows. Without this pass NOTHING re-drives that
row, so an operator's « Merger », « Créer PR » or « Refuser » would be persisted and then never
executed — which is exactly the shape of the defect review found for rejections.

The release is fenced on the decision identity the hold recorded: identical means nothing moved
since the card parked (leave it held, or a 2-second poll would re-dispatch forever), different means
the operator acted, a receipt landed, or the lock changed, and the graph must look again. It is
therefore both the wake-up after a decision AND the crash-recovery for a decision whose wake-up was
lost, with no separate scheduler.

It never decides anything: the barrier re-evaluates the durable state and may simply park again.

/**
 * InProcessRuntime runs a project within the main process.
 *
 * This is the default execution mode — all components (TaskStore, Scheduler,
 * Executor) share the same memory space and event loop.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Direct access to TaskStore and Scheduler via getter methods
 * - Synchronous event forwarding from TaskStore to runtime listeners
 * - Graceful shutdown with configurable timeout
 * - Automatic orphaned task recovery on startup
 *
 * Lifecycle boundary:
 * - Mesh networking services (PeerExchangeService + mDNS discovery) are process-level
 *   concerns owned by CLI startup paths (`runServe`/`runDashboard`) because discovery
 *   requires the final bound HTTP port. InProcessRuntime remains project-scoped and
 *   intentionally does not start process-level mesh services.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const config: ProjectRuntimeConfig = {
 *   projectId: "proj_abc123",
 *   workingDirectory: "/path/to/project",
 *   isolationMode: "in-process",
 *   maxConcurrent: 2,
 *   maxWorktrees: 4,
 * };
 *
 * const runtime = new InProcessRuntime(config, centralCore);
 * await runtime.start();
 *
 * // Access components directly
 * const taskStore = runtime.getTaskStore();
 * const scheduler = runtime.getScheduler();
 *
 * await runtime.stop();
 * ```
