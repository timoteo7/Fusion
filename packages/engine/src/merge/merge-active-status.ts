/**
 * Shared definition of "a task is stamped with an active merge status".
 *
 * FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-07-15-21:45 (FN-8004 follow-up):
 * A merge-active status (`merging`/`reviewing`/`landing`/…) means "a merger owns this task right
 * now". Two consumers must agree on when that stamp is STALE — i.e. no live merger holds it:
 *
 *  - `SelfHealingManager.recoverStaleMergingStatus()` clears the stamp automatically.
 *  - The dashboard's manual Retry gate refuses to retry a task that a live merger owns.
 *
 * Before this module they did NOT agree: self-healing recovered stale stamps after a bounded
 * delay, but the manual gate rejected EVERY merge-active status outright ("Task is not in a
 * retryable state (current status: landing)"). So when a merger died mid-flight — a crash, an
 * engine restart, an operator SIGTERM — the operator's own escape hatch was blocked precisely
 * when they needed it, and the only recourse was waiting out the sweep.
 *
 * This is the same class of bug as the FN-8004 transient-classifier split: one concept, two
 * definitions, silently diverging. Keeping the predicate here means the manual path can never be
 * stricter than the automatic one.
 *
 * Leaf module by design — types only, no logger/store imports — so both the engine's sweep and
 * the dashboard route can import it without inheriting a runtime dependency chain.

 * for the age-based stale heuristic: retry/orphan log writes can refresh `updatedAt`, so age can
 * never certify the stamp left by the attempt being recovered. Soundness instead comes from each
 * caller's closed writer set: `drainMergeQueue` serializes holders with `mergeRunning`, while an
 * aborted body is fenced from status writes by its own abort signal. A compare-on-write cannot
 * distinguish stale `merging` from a newly-written `merging`, and a single-flight claim alone is

 *  1. it carries a merge-active status;
 *  2. it is not the in-process merge owner (`activeMergeTaskId`), which proves a live merger; and
 *  3. its `updatedAt` has not moved for `minAgeMs`, so a merger that is slow but progressing
 *     (each phase writes a log entry, refreshing `updatedAt`) is never mistaken for a dead one.
 *
 * Rule 3 is what makes this safe to expose to a manual Retry button: an operator cannot yank a
 * merge that is actually running, because a running merge keeps its own stamp fresh.
