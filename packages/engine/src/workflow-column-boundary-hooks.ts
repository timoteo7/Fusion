/*
FNXC:WorkflowColumnBoundary 2026-07-27-16:40 (E2E validation seam — PR #2475 review, P2):

THE production wiring that binds the graph's column-boundary controller to the store, lifted out
of `Executor.buildColumnBoundaryHooks` so there is exactly ONE copy of it.

WHY IT MOVED. The E2E suite needs to drive the REAL boundary wiring, and `buildColumnBoundaryHooks`
was a private method reachable only by constructing a whole Executor. The test therefore rebuilt
the hooks by hand — and the hand copy DIVERGED in three ways within a single PR cycle (a broader
active-continuation filter, a missing graph-owned-move marker, and a different audit run id). A
test that rebuilds the wiring proves the copy works, which is the same failure shape as a spy that
passes on an event the bus refused. Extracting the factory is the smallest seam that lets the test
exercise the real thing; the Executor now delegates and owns only what is genuinely Executor state
(the in-flight move set and its logger), passed in as callbacks.

Behavior is byte-identical to the method it replaces — this is a move, not a rewrite.
