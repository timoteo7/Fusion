/*
FNXC:SpecDrift 2026-08-10-18:32 (connection-exhaustion incident):
Reconciliation is CONCURRENCY-BOUNDED because each run costs a dedicated PostgreSQL connection, not a
pooled one. `persist` -> `appendSpecDriftReport` -> `withPlanningLifecycleLock` opens its own
`postgres(directUrl, { max: 1 })` session, because the planning advisory lock is session-scoped and
deliberately fences a stale report against a newer plan (see `appendSpecDriftReportWhilePlanningLocked`).

Unbounded fan-out therefore converts directly into unbounded connections. At runtime boundary setup
`project-engine.ts` enqueues EVERY task (`listTasks({ includeArchived: true })`) and `enqueue` released
each one straight into a `queueMicrotask`, so a 1,082-task project opened ~1,082 lock sessions at once
against `max_connections = 500`. The cluster saturated ~25s into boot; every later query then failed
with "sorry, too many clients already", including the engine's own startup, so Fusion wedged on
"starting" behind the migration holding server and never recovered.

The flat 1s retry made it self-sustaining rather than transient: once saturated, every task failed and
re-armed at a fixed 1s, so ~1,082 tasks re-opened ~1,082 sessions every second indefinitely (measured:
4,777 lock sessions in 17s). Backoff is exponential + jittered so a persistent outage decays instead of
pinning the resource it is waiting on.
