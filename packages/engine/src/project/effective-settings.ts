/**
 * Engine-side helper: merge per-task EFFECTIVE workflow settings (U3, KTD-3) over a
 * base settings object fetched from the store, so the engine's flat
 * `settings.<key>` read sites pick up workflow-setting values with zero changes at
 * the read sites.
 *
 * TWO-TIER MERGE (the parity-preserving rule):
 *  - a STORED flat value ALWAYS overrides the base (workflow policy, or the
 *    project workflow-model baseline);
 *  - a declaration-DEFAULT-only key (no stored value) only FILLS the base when the
 *    base lacks the key.
 *
 * This is what keeps U3 behavior-identical BEFORE the U4 hard-move: a customized
 * project setting still present in the base is NOT clobbered by a declaration
 * default; only a real stored workflow value overrides it. After the hard-move the
 * base lacks the moved key, so the declaration default fills it. Absent-default
 * model lanes contribute nothing. Lower-precedence selected-workflow model lanes
 * are retained separately for the centralized model resolver.
 *
 * `resolveEffectiveSettingsDetailed` never throws (degrades to declaration
 * defaults), so this helper is a thin store-coupled wrapper that also never throws.
