FNXC:PlanArtifactPersistence 2026-07-26-03:55:
Planning sessions run in the TASK's own worktree (see FNXC:NodeWorktreeIsolation in triage.ts), and they
carry the full coding tool surface. The system prompt tells the planner to persist through
`fn_task_prompt_write`, but that is a soft instruction: a planner that reaches for the generic write tool
writes the relative spec path (`.fusion/tasks/<id>/PROMPT.md`) against its own cwd, so the spec lands
INSIDE the worktree. Triage then finalizes by reading `<rootDir>/<promptPath>`, sees nothing, and fails
deterministic validation — and the worktree copy is destroyed with the worktree.

Two durability requirements follow, and this module owns both:
1. A plan written inside a worktree is copied back into the main project `.fusion/` folder. The copy goes
   through `store.updateTask({ prompt })`, which is the single validated persistence path (File Scope
   validation, root PROMPT.md write, and task.json sync stay together and stay atomic).
2. The authoritative plan is mirrored into the project database. `project.tasks` has no `prompt` column —
   PROMPT.md is filesystem-only and is hydrated on read — so losing the project checkout loses every spec.
   The mirror uses the existing `task_documents` store under the `plan` key, which triage already reads as
   a planning-draft fallback (`readNonEmptyPlanningDraft`), so recovery has a DB-backed source of truth.
