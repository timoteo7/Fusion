/**
 * Engine run-audit instrumentation helpers.
 *
 * Provides a shared layer for emitting run-audit events from heartbeat execution,
 * task execution, and merge operations. Uses the core TaskStore APIs introduced
 * by FN-1403 for event persistence.
 *
 * ## Run Context
 *
 * Every active run (heartbeat, executor, merger) has an associated run context
 * that enables correlation of mutations back to the specific run that caused them:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * interface EngineRunContext {
 *   runId: string;           // Stable run identifier (heartbeat run ID, or synthetic for executor/merger)
 *   agentId: string;          // Agent performing the mutation
 *   taskId?: string;          // Task being operated on (if applicable)
 *   phase?: string;           // Execution phase: "heartbeat", "execute", "merge-attempt-N"
 *   source?: string;          // Invocation source: "timer", "on_demand", "assignment", etc.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Create auditor with a run context (no-ops if context is null/undefined)
 * const auditor = createRunAuditor(store, runContext);
 *
 * // Emit audit events for different mutation domains
 * await auditor.git({ type: "branch:create", target: branchName });
 * await auditor.database({ type: "task:update", target: taskId });
 * await auditor.filesystem({ type: "file:write", target: filePath });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Backward Compatibility
 *
 * All audit functions are no-ops when:
 * - The auditor was created with a null/undefined context
 * - The TaskStore doesn't have `recordRunAuditEvent` (not yet migrated)
 *
 * This ensures manual/non-run paths are unaffected by audit instrumentation.
