          FN-8783 confirms W32's engine-core lane has 22 exact policy files.
          The current core bundle remains the only evidence-backed import-path
          optimization: it is rebuilt every run, retains mock interception, and
          avoids the measured-slower engine-graph bundle designs below. Keep pool,
          worker budgeting, file parallelism, and this alias intact; membership is
          pinned in scripts/__tests__/engine-vitest-gate-policy.test.mjs.

          FNXC:EngineTests 2026-07-08-04:50:
          FN-7669: the @fusion/core alias now points at a PRE-BUNDLED single ESM
          file (packages/core/.gate-bundle/core.mjs — a SIBLING of
          packages/core/node_modules/, deliberately NOT nested inside it; nesting
          inside node_modules triggers Vite's SSR external-dep heuristic and
          silently defeats vi.mock interception for imports nested inside the
          bundle, see scripts/build-engine-core-gate-bundle.mjs for the full repro)
          instead of directly at index.gate.ts's source. FN-7668 profiled the
          gate's dominant wall-time cost as vitest/Vite SSR's import-phase — each
          of the fork workers independently re-resolving+evaluating the ~430-file
          barrel closure with zero cross-fork sharing. esbuild-
          bundling the index.gate.ts closure (220 first-party files, the
          @fusion/core slice of that ~430) into one file
          (scripts/build-engine-core-gate-bundle.mjs, wired below via globalSetup
          so it is rebuilt fresh before every gate invocation — never a hand-
          maintained/stale artifact) collapses that to a single file load per
          fork. See the task's docs document for the full A/B measurement,
          coverage-parity proof, and land/no-land rationale.
          @fusion/engine is deliberately left on the full barrel, unbundled: none
          of the originally profiled curated files imported "@fusion/engine" at
          all, so bundling it would be zero-benefit
          churn/risk — and it would additionally risk double-registering or
          dead-locking the core↔engine circular-import DI
          (`void import("@fusion/core").then(setCreateFnAgent...)` in
          packages/engine/src/index.ts) for no measured gain.

          FN-7670 prototyped extending this same lever to the @fusion/engine
          RELATIVE-import production graph (`../merger.js`, `../hold-release.js`,
          `../scheduler.js`, `../workflow-node-handlers.js`, ...) that curated gate
          files reach directly — NOT the barrel above, which stays untouched per
          the paragraph above regardless. It built a fully working, coverage-
          parity-preserving, mock-safe bundle (171 first-party files → 35 output
          files via esbuild multi-entry splitting) but an interleaved, host-load-
          controlled A/B showed NO clear incremental wall-time win over this
          @fusion/core-only bundle (delta within this host's own ~2.5x run-to-run
          noise band) — the byte-size growth of 14 separate large root bundles
          (e.g. one alone reached 1.3MB) offset the per-file-dispatch savings that
          made the single-file @fusion/core bundle above pay off. NOT landed; the
          wiring was reverted to this @fusion/core-only state. See FN-7670's task
          docs document for the full closure/mock-boundary analysis, the A/B
          methodology and data, and the negative-result rationale.

          FNXC:EngineTests 2026-07-08-06:20:
          FN-7673 re-attempted this lever with a SINGLE COMBINED-ENTRY design
          (all 14 mock-safe roots redirected via a resolveId plugin to ONE
          packages/engine/.gate-bundle/engine.mjs, no `splitting`, mirroring the
          @fusion/core bundle's one-alias/one-output-file shape) rather than
          FN-7670's 14-separate-root design. It achieved the design goal (149
          first-party inputs -> 1 output file) and full coverage parity (335/335)
          but a TRUE interleaved A/B (5 warm pairs + 1 cold pair) showed the
          combined-entry bundle is CONSISTENTLY SLOWER than this @fusion/core-only
          baseline — warm median real +29.1% slower, import-phase aggregate
          +74.0% slower, holding across every pair (not within this host's noise
          band, unlike FN-7670's inconclusive result). Working theory: funnelling
          all 14 original relative-import sites through a `resolveId`-plugin
          redirect to one large (2.3MB) synthetic `export *` file adds more
          transform/resolution overhead than it saves, unlike the @fusion/core
          bundle's plain `resolve.alias` (a single fixed target, no per-specifier
          plugin hook). NOT landed; wiring fully reverted to this @fusion/core-
          only state (both the engine-graph scans and the combined-entry builder
          were removed from scripts/build-engine-core-gate-bundle.mjs, and the
          resolveId plugin was removed from this file — full diff in FN-7673's
          git history). This lever (bundling the @fusion/engine relative-import
          graph for the engine-core gate, in either a 14-file or single-combined-
          entry shape) is now considered CLOSED — do not re-attempt without new
          evidence changing the underlying cost model. See FN-7673's task docs
          document for the full A/B data, the mock-boundary risk finding (a
          combined-entry design broke a shared-test-helper vi.mock in a way
          FN-7670's per-root design never could), and the closure rationale.

            THE MOVE-TARGET RATCHET BELONGS HERE FOR THE SAME REASON THE CENSUS RATCHET ABOVE DOES,

            The census counts COMPARISONS; a move target is an ARGUMENT, so nothing above sees it. And
            the failure mode is harder than a stale guard's: `moveTaskInternal` REJECTS a target the
