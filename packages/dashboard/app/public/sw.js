Mobile browsers (iOS Safari tabs, iOS installed PWAs, Chrome Android) discard backgrounded pages under memory pressure. When the user returns, the tab is re-navigated from scratch, so restore cost IS the perceived bug: a network-first bundle refetch pulls ~2.8MB raw / 750KB gzipped of entry chunk (14MB across ~130 chunks) over a just-waking radio before anything paints, producing the white splash.

Vite emits content-hashed asset filenames (`[name]-[hash].[ext]`), so a hashed URL's bytes can never change — a new build emits a NEW url. Those are therefore safe to serve cache-first: a cache hit is authoritative, and a post-deploy hash simply misses and is fetched. HASHED_ASSET_PATTERN is the conservative gate for that guarantee; anything under /assets/ that does not prove it carries a hash stays network-first.

Conservatism rules for the pattern: the trailing dash-delimited segment of the basename must be >=8 chars of Vite's base64url hash alphabet (dash permitted only as the final character, which keeps the segment genuinely trailing instead of letting the match span earlier dashes) AND must contain at least one uppercase letter or digit. Human-authored kebab-case basenames (`vendor-runtime.js`, `foo-bar-baz.css`) fail the mixed-alphabet check and stay network-first. A real hash fails the pattern only when it embeds a dash before its last character (~10% of hashes) or is all-lowercase-alpha ((28/64)^8, ~0.1%); both are harmless downgrades to the previous network-first behavior, never a stale-serve.

Cache-first hashed assets made cache SIZE load-bearing, and nothing evicted within a generation — `activate` only drops caches whose key !== CACHE_NAME, and CACHE_NAME is a hand-bumped literal. Fusion is self-hosted and rebuilt constantly (Command Center "Rebuild + restart" reloads the page onto a new build), each build emitting ~130 fresh hashed chunks (~14MB). Every prior build's chunks stayed resident forever, so a week of daily rebuilds parks ~100MB of dead chunks on the origin. On iOS the origin quota is enforced per-origin and eviction is ALL-OR-NOTHING for the bucket: blowing it wipes localStorage too, taking out the SWR board snapshot and the `kb-dashboard-*` preferences that the rest of the restore work depends on. So the unbounded cache does not merely waste disk — it can destroy the very state that makes restore cheap.

Chosen bound: an insertion-ordered entry cap over hashed /assets/ entries only.
- Why not "keep only what the current index.html references": index.html names only the entry chunk; the other ~129 are lazy imports discovered inside JS. Reconstructing that graph in the SW means parsing bundles — fragile, and a mis-parse strands the user on a failed dynamic import.
- Why not a CACHE_NAME-per-build bump: correct in principle, but CACHE_NAME is a literal in a static, untemplated file. Doing it properly needs build-time templating of sw.js (a Vite plugin emitting the build hash) — real build wiring, not a one-line change, and out of scope here. Recorded as the eventual better answer rather than faked with a hardcoded hash.
- Why insertion order is the right recency proxy: hashed URLs are immutable, so an entry is only ever inserted once, at the moment its build first ran. Cache API `keys()` is specified to return entries in insertion order, so oldest-first == oldest-build-first. Evicting from the front removes dead builds before live ones, with no metadata bookkeeping to persist or corrupt.

Partial safety against evicting an asset the RUNNING build still needs: every hashed URL this service-worker SESSION has served (hit or miss) is recorded in `sessionReferencedAssets` and is exempt from eviction while it remains in that set (itself bounded — see MAX_SESSION_REFERENCED_ASSETS).

CORRECTION 2026-07-26-18:05 — the previous wording ("A chunk the current page has already loaded is thereby pinned") asserted a guarantee this code does not deliver, and the claim must not be reintroduced. `sessionReferencedAssets` is an in-memory Set in the worker's global scope, and browsers idle-terminate a service worker after ~30s of no events — the normal state of a BACKGROUNDED tab, i.e. exactly the scenario this feature exists for. The worker that wakes to serve the restored tab is a cold start with an EMPTY set, so on the first prune after every wake NOTHING is pinned.

What actually bounds the residual risk, and why it was left as-is rather than papered over:
- Eviction is oldest-INSERTED-first, and the running build's chunks are the most recently inserted, so the natural ordering already protects them in the common case. The pin set only adds protection in the uncommon inversion where a live build's chunks are older than some other build's — e.g. a long-lived tab on build N while another tab loaded build N+1.
- Durably persisting the set would re-pin a PREVIOUS build's chunks on every restart with no way to tell which build is now live, converting a bounded eviction risk into an unbounded pinning one. Not worth it for the inversion case.
- The failure mode is a re-fetch, not a break: an evicted chunk still on the server is fetched again. The only unrecoverable case (chunk gone from the server) is the stale-chunk case `versionCheck.ts`'s handleChunkLoadError/isStaleChunkError already handles, and it would occur with no cache at all.

The eviction-exemption set must itself be bounded, or it re-opens the hole it exists to make safe: a
service worker that survives many rebuilds (they are cheap to keep alive under active use) would
accumulate every build's served chunks as permanently-exempt and the cap could never bite. Capping it
drop-oldest makes the resident set provably bounded at MAX_IMMUTABLE_CACHE_ENTRIES +
MAX_SESSION_REFERENCED_ASSETS in the worst case rather than unbounded. Dropping the oldest exemption

The hashed-asset cap above left the OTHER unbounded writer in this file untouched: every GET /api/ response is put into the same CACHE_NAME and nothing ever evicted those entries. The dashboard issues a large and open-ended set of distinct /api/ URLs (per project, per task, per query string), so the API half grew without limit — the same iOS all-or-nothing per-origin quota hazard the asset cap exists to prevent, where blowing the bucket wipes localStorage (SWR board snapshot, `kb-dashboard-*` prefs) alongside the caches.

Size is only half the defect. This cache is the OFFLINE FALLBACK: on a network failure a cached entry is served transparently to the app, which cannot tell it apart from a live response. With no expiry, an hours-old task list could be handed to the board during a brief radio blip — a correctness bug worse than the failed fetch it papers over. So the API entries get BOTH a count cap and a freshness bound.

Why not "stop caching /api/ entirely": the fallback is cheap and does earn a narrow keep. Warm hydration is NOT what depends on it — the app hydrates from its own localStorage/session snapshots — but a mobile tab restored onto a waking radio issues its first API burst before the connection settles, and a seconds-to-minutes-old response there is strictly better than an error state. That value evaporates fast, hence a short TTL rather than an unbounded fallback.

Freshness accounting, in precedence order:
1. `apiCacheTimestamps` — recorded at put time, same clock as the read, exact.
2. the response's `Date` header — Fusion serves its own API from Node, which always sets it, so a service worker that restarted (the common case after a discard) can still prove age.
3. otherwise UNKNOWN, which counts as stale. Fail-closed: an entry whose age cannot be proven is never served. The cost is one failed request that would have failed anyway without a cache; the alternative is exactly the unbounded-staleness bug being fixed.
A negative age (client clock behind the server's) is also treated as unprovable rather than clamped to fresh, so clock skew cannot mint an immortal entry.

WHICH /api/ responses may be written at all. Previously: every successful GET /api/*. That included
GET /api/settings and /api/settings/global, which return `daemonToken`, `githubAuthToken`,
`gitlabAuthToken`, and `ntfyAccessToken` as plaintext — so dashboard credentials were persisted to
durable Cache Storage, survived logout, token rotation, and project switch (nothing in the app touched
the caches API until the purge added in swrCache.ts), and were readable by any script on the origin.
The entry cap and TTL added earlier bound size and staleness; neither is a confidentiality control.

ALLOW-list, not deny-list. A deny-list fails OPEN: every endpoint added later is cached until someone
remembers to exclude it, which is exactly how the credential endpoints got here. The allow-list fails
closed — a new endpoint is network-only until someone argues it into this list.

What earns a place: only reads whose offline fallback has real value on the mobile-restore path this
whole feature targets (a restored tab issues its first API burst before the radio settles, where a
seconds-old body beats an error state) AND whose bodies carry no credential, secret, or token.
- `/api/tasks` and `/api/tasks/<id>`: the board and the card the user was looking at.
- `/api/projects`: the project list the board is keyed by.
Everything else — settings, secrets, auth, agents, git, chat, artifacts, attachments — goes straight to
the network with no cache write and no fallback read. The cost is an error state on a blip for those
views; the alternative is deciding, endpoint by endpoint forever, whether a body is sensitive.

Durable put-time stamp. `apiCacheTimestamps` is a plain Map in the service worker's global scope, and
browsers idle-terminate a service worker after ~30s — which is precisely what happens while the tab is

EMPTY and every surviving entry's age had to be proven from the server `Date` header alone. That header
is a real fallback but it is the ORIGIN's send time, not our put time, and an intermediary or a response
replayed from an HTTP cache can make it arbitrarily older than the entry. Stamping our own header at put
time makes age provable across a worker restart with the same clock the read uses.

Fails soft by design: if `Response`/`Headers` are unavailable, the status cannot carry a body (204/304),
or the body read throws, the caller falls back to putting the plain clone and age falls back to `Date`.

Both bounded classes (hashed assets, /api/ responses) share ONE policy-driven sweep over ONE keys()
scan rather than two parallel implementations walking the cache separately. A policy declares which
URLs it owns, its entry cap, which entries are pinned, and which are provably expired.

`isExpired` is deliberately allowed to answer only for entries whose age is PROVABLE. An /api/ entry
with no recorded timestamp is never served (see isFreshApiCacheEntry) but is also not force-evicted
here; the cap reclaims it in insertion order. This keeps the sweep from deleting entries it cannot
reason about — e.g. those written by a previous SW session — as a side effect of an asset prune.

Amended 2026-07-26-18:05: be explicit that after an idle-termination cold start BOTH in-memory
structures are empty, so a prune then sees zero pinned assets and zero provably-expired API entries and
degrades to a pure oldest-first cap sweep. That is correct behavior, not a gap: the cap is the quota
guard, and the freshness guarantee lives on the READ path (isFreshApiCacheEntry via the durable
SW_CACHED_AT_HEADER stamp), which never depends on these maps surviving. `isExpired` deliberately does
not open each entry to read that header — that would turn the sweep into an O(cache) match() storm on
the hot path to reclaim disk it will reclaim by cap anyway.

Entries outside every policy (the navigation shell, unhashed assets, fonts, icons) are a small fixed
set and stay untouched, as before.

Operator-triggered Cache Storage purge, the service-worker half of `clearAllLocalCache()` (swrCache.ts).
Settings -> "Clear all cached data" wipes localStorage and then immediately reloads the page, which can
abort an in-page `caches.delete()` mid-flight. The service worker is NOT torn down by that reload, so
routing the purge through it is what makes the delete actually land. The page still performs its own
direct purge as well: a page with no controlling worker (first load, dev without SW) would otherwise get
no purge at all. Both paths are idempotent — deleting an absent cache is a no-op.

  FNXC:VersionAutoReload 2026-09-18-00:20:
  FN-516: update METADATA is never an offline resource. `/version.json` states what the server is
  serving RIGHT NOW; a remembered answer is not a degraded version of that signal, it is a false one.
  Before this gate the URL matched no earlier branch (not a navigation, not `/api/`, not an asset) and
  fell into the generic cache-first tail at the bottom of this handler, so the first response was
  written to durable Cache Storage and every later read was answered from it without a network call.
  That entry outlives worker termination and browser restarts, so a tab already running build B could
  read build A twice and versionCheck would confirm a deployment that never happened and reload the
  page under the operator — the reported "the app refreshes by itself" symptom.

  Unlike the /api/ fallback there is nothing to trade off: an unavailable read is already handled
  upstream (versionCheck treats it as "no evidence" and does nothing), while a stale read costs the
  user their page. So the request is passed through untouched — no read, no write, no fallback — and
  the gate sits ahead of every generic branch. Query strings are covered because the match is on the
  pathname, so a cache-busting parameter cannot route around it. Entries a previous worker generation
  already wrote may remain physically present; they are simply never consulted again.

  Immutable assets are served CACHE-FIRST: a hit returns without touching the network, so a discarded-and-restored mobile tab repaints from local storage instead of re-downloading the bundle over a waking radio. On a miss we fetch, populate, and return.

  This replaces the previous network-first-for-everything rule, which existed out of a stale-JS fear. That fear does not apply here: the URL is content-hashed, so its bytes are immutable and a hit can never be "stale" — a rebuild produces a different URL, which misses. The fear DOES apply to the navigation shell, which is why that branch above is left network-first.

  Only `response.ok` is cached. A hashed URL that 404s (deploy mid-flight, partially uploaded build) must never be pinned into an immutable cache entry, because nothing would ever evict it before the next CACHE_NAME bump.
