Destroying the task snapshot is only justified when the server actually answered and disagreed with it
(non-2xx, or a response that would not parse). A transport-level rejection on a waking mobile radio —
"Load failed" / "Failed to fetch" / an offline navigator — proves nothing about the snapshot's contents.

Before this guard, the mount revalidation's `clearOnError` catch ran on those rejections and both blanked
the hydrated board and deleted the cache entry, so the NEXT restore also started empty: a suspension
failure permanently defeated the feature the raised `SWR_TASKS_MAX_AGE_MS` exists to serve. Nine sibling
hooks (useProjects, useNodes, useMeshState, useExecutorStats, useUsageData, useMeshEngines,
useManagedDockerNodes, useProjectHealth) already guard this with the same `visibilitySuspension`
predicate; this reuses it rather than adding a tenth copy.

`navigator.onLine === false` is authoritative for "no request left the device"; `true` is not evidence of
reachability, so the message check still has to run. `lastRefreshErrorAt` is set either way, so the
re-entry/visibility retry paths still fire.

  stall fields are produced ONLY for review-lane cards — every assignment in `task-store/reads.ts`
  routes through a producer that gates on review itself:

    inReviewStall    getInReviewStallReason      (gates on the review lane)

  So `!task.inReviewStall && !task.inReviewStalled && !task.stalledReview` already means "not a
  review card with a stall badge", and re-asserting the column added nothing a correct board could
  observe.

  WHAT IT DID ADD WAS A BUG, and it is live today rather than pending anything. `inReviewStalled` is
  ALREADY resolved by role, so a renamed board DOES produce that badge — and this literal then
  refused to clear it while a review agent was actively writing logs. The card read "stalled" for
  the whole time work was visibly happening, which is exactly what this function exists to prevent.

  I previously recorded this as a cross-batch coupling that cancelled out and had to be ordered
  against core. That was wrong on one of the three signals: the trait-converted one never cancelled.
  Deleting the check is correct before OR after any core change, and removes the ordering hazard

This is the SOURCE of the planner-activity signal, and it was the narrowest gate of all:
it only stamped `recentAgentActivityAt` for cards literally in `triage`. #2515 removed
that column from the default lineage, so after that merge the stamp never happened for a
default-workflow card — and every consumer downstream (the pulsing Planning badge, the
agent-active row border, the column's executing count) had NO DATA to act on, however
correctly they resolved their own column traits.

Converting the consumers without this would have been cosmetic: they would ask the right
question of a field nothing ever set.

This hook processes SSE and has no resolved column metadata, so the lane is matched by id
against BOTH shapes — pre-merge `triage` and post-merge `todo`. Over-stamping a legacy

Resolved traits win; the legacy pair stays as the no-flags fallback, so an unconverted caller and the

The scheduler can refresh the board while a task-detail host holds a newer queued dependency or
file-overlap snapshot. Providers (SWR, SSE, fetchTaskDetail, and local mutations) do not share an
arrival order, so lifecycle rendering must use the existing timestamp evidence: a later `columnMovedAt`
owns a real column transition; within that column, a later `updatedAt` owns status. Equal or absent
clock evidence retains the already-visible known lifecycle state unless a complete server snapshot is
newer than the row and resolves an equal legacy move clock; sparse SSE patches never receive that tie-break.

This helper intentionally merges only defined sparse fields and retains a fetched detail's prompt/log
when a slim board row arrives. Every open-detail host and useTasks ingestion uses this one boundary so
one provider cannot regress a modal, main panel, split detail, dock, or popup independently.

  a waking radio, a single unrelated task:created event used to stamp the whole board as measured-from-
  now — re-creating, through a sibling path, the exact "every in-progress card renders stuck" regression
  the savedAt seeding was added to fix.

  Once a fetch HAS confirmed the board, advancing on a live event stays honest and is deliberately kept:
  the stream reports every task mutation in the project, so a row that produced no event really has not
