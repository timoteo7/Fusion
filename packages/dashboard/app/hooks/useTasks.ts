Destroying the task snapshot is only justified when the server actually answered and disagreed with it
(non-2xx, or a response that would not parse). A transport-level rejection on a waking mobile radio —
"Load failed" / "Failed to fetch" / an offline navigator — proves nothing about the snapshot's contents.

Before this guard, the mount revalidation's `clearOnError` catch ran on those rejections and both blanked
the hydrated board and deleted the cache entry, so the NEXT restore also started empty: a suspension
failure permanently defeated the feature the raised `SWR_TASKS_MAX_AGE_MS` exists to serve. Nine sibling
hooks (useProjects, useNodes, useMeshState, useExecutorStats, useUsageData, useMeshEngines,
useManagedDockerNodes, useProjectHealth) already guard this with the same `visibilitySuspension`
predicate; this reuses it rather than adding a tenth copy.

`navigator.onLine === false` is authoritative for "no request left the device"; `true` is not evidence of
reachability, so the message check still has to run. `lastRefreshErrorAt` is set either way, so the

  routes through a producer that gates on review itself:

    inReviewStall    getInReviewStallReason      (gates on the review lane)

  So `!task.inReviewStall && !task.inReviewStalled && !task.stalledReview` already means "not a
  review card with a stall badge", and re-asserting the column added nothing a correct board could
  observe.

  WHAT IT DID ADD WAS A BUG, and it is live today rather than pending anything. `inReviewStalled` is
  ALREADY resolved by role, so a renamed board DOES produce that badge — and this literal then
  refused to clear it while a review agent was actively writing logs. The card read "stalled" for
  the whole time work was visibly happening, which is exactly what this function exists to prevent.

  I previously recorded this as a cross-batch coupling that cancelled out and had to be ordered

  Deleting the check is correct before OR after any core change, and removes the ordering hazard

This is the SOURCE of the planner-activity signal, and it was the narrowest gate of all:
it only stamped `recentAgentActivityAt` for cards literally in `triage`. #2515 removed
that column from the default lineage, so after that merge the stamp never happened for a
default-workflow card — and every consumer downstream (the pulsing Planning badge, the
agent-active row border, the column's executing count) had NO DATA to act on, however
correctly they resolved their own column traits.

Converting the consumers without this would have been cosmetic: they would ask the right
question of a field nothing ever set.

This hook processes SSE and has no resolved column metadata, so the lane is matched by id
against BOTH shapes — pre-merge `triage` and post-merge `todo`. Over-stamping a legacy

FNXC:TaskDetailStateStability 2026-08-05-02:55:
The scheduler can refresh the board while a task-detail host holds a newer queued dependency or
file-overlap snapshot. Providers (SWR, SSE, fetchTaskDetail, and local mutations) do not share an
arrival order, so lifecycle rendering must use the existing timestamp evidence: a later `columnMovedAt`
owns a real column transition; within that column, a later `updatedAt` owns status. Equal or absent
clock evidence retains the already-visible known lifecycle state unless a complete server snapshot is
newer than the row and resolves an equal legacy move clock; sparse SSE patches never receive that tie-break.

This helper intentionally merges only defined sparse fields. A slim or sparse payload's absent, empty, or whitespace-only prompt is not evidence that a loaded plan was cleared, and an empty log is not evidence that a populated journal was cleared; marked full snapshots remain authoritative for both fields. Every open-detail host and useTasks ingestion uses this one boundary so one provider cannot regress a modal, main panel, split detail, dock, or popup independently.

`mergeTaskSnapshot` arbitrates server snapshots only. Locally-authored detail patches must use
`applyLocalTaskPatch`: FN-5148 requires mismatched ids to be ignored while accepting an absent id, and

  snapshot that may be hours old (`SWR_TASKS_MAX_AGE_MS`). That is safe only because hydration is

  REACHED THE SERVER. A transport-level rejection (suspended tab, offline radio) now leaves the entry

  now — re-creating, through a sibling path, the exact "every in-progress card renders stuck" regression
  the savedAt seeding was added to fix.

  Once a fetch HAS confirmed the board, advancing on a live event stays honest and is deliberately kept:
  the stream reports every task mutation in the project, so a row that produced no event really has not

      Load-bearing for the long hydration TTL: a snapshot is only allowed to outlive a tab discard
      because a failed revalidation deletes it here. Without this, an unverifiable board could be
      re-hydrated on every subsequent restore for the whole TTL window. Do not weaken.

      FNXC:MobileTabDiscard 2026-07-26-16:40:
      CORRECTION — the 10:52 note above claimed "a failed revalidation deletes it", and the code did
      exactly that for EVERY failure. That was wrong, and it broke the case the cache exists for: the
      mount revalidation runs on a just-woken mobile radio, where the first fetch routinely rejects at
      the transport layer. Such a rejection carries no information about the snapshot, yet it deleted
      the entry AND (with `clearOnError`) blanked the freshly hydrated board — so the restore went white
      and the next restore had nothing left to hydrate. Only a failure that actually reached the server
      is allowed to destroy the snapshot; see `didFailureReachServer`. Suspension/offline failures leave
      both the cache and the on-screen rows intact and rely on the retry paths keyed off
      `lastRefreshErrorAt`.
