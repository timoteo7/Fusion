FNXC:TaskTitleDisplay 2026-09-14-17:20:
FN-391 makes `getTaskTitleDisplay` the ONE projection every task label goes through. The behavioral
tests prove each surface renders the right text today; this closed census is what stops the next
author from adding a thirteenth surface with an inline `task.title || task.description || task.id`
expression, which is exactly how the label rule ended up copied across a dozen components.

It asserts CODE CONSTRUCTS, not prose: the forbidden expression shape, and the presence of the
shared import in each surface that renders a task label. Both are mechanically checkable and both
fail loudly when the rule is bypassed.
