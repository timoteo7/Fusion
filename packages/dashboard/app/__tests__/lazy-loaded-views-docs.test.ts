FNXC:CommandCenter 2026-06-16-09:40:
The Command Center view (PR #1683) is an App-level lazy-loaded view added to the curated inventory. This
test enforces that the inventory in AGENTS.md stays in sync with App.tsx (and AppModals.tsx).

FNXC:CommandCenter 2026-06-17-09:00:
Merging main reconciled the curated count to 23 (main's 22 lazy views/modals + Command Center).

FNXC:CommandCenter 2026-06-19-00:00:
FN-6702 removes ReliabilityView from the App-level lazy inventory because Reliability now mounts inside the lazy CommandCenter chunk.

FNXC:CommandCenter 2026-06-19-00:00:
FN-6717 removes NodesView from the App-level lazy inventory because Nodes now mounts inside the lazy CommandCenter chunk.

FNXC:GitManager 2026-06-21-00:00:
FN-6881 removes StashRecoveryView from the App-level lazy inventory because Stash Recovery now mounts through the lazy GitManagerModal chunk.

FNXC:DashboardLazyViews 2026-06-22-00:00:
The navigation reshuffle promotes Workflows, Import Tasks, Automations, and Settings as embedded views that reuse existing lazy chunks. Their underscore-prefixed App consts stay out of the curated inventory so the docs count each heavy chunk once.

FNXC:DashboardLazyViews 2026-06-26-00:00:
Curated chunks declared outside App.tsx/AppModals.tsx (Plugins settings section, AgentsView) must be scanned at their real call sites so the inventory cannot drift while this guard stays green.

FNXC:DashboardLazyViews 2026-06-26-00:00:
Session terminals, onboarding internals, and overflow re-imports of already-counted chunks are explicit exclusions because they are not new heavy top-level views or modals for the AGENTS inventory.
