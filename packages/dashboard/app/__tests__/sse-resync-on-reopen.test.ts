Invariant coverage for the sse-bus missed-event contract.

The requirement: the bus tears every EventSource down after SSE_HIDDEN_SUSPEND_DELAY_MS hidden (the
mobile page-discard fix) and /api/events has NO replay buffer, so every event emitted during that
window is lost forever. A subscriber that mutates state only from event handlers therefore diverges
permanently from the server. The invariant every subscriber must satisfy is: hidden -> suspend ->
server state changes while suspended -> visible -> reopen CONVERGES the hook on the server's state.

This is asserted as a general invariant, not one repro: three representative hooks exercise the full
suspend/reopen cycle (an approval raised while suspended, a merge landed while suspended, a chat
reply arrived while suspended), and a coverage ratchet asserts that EVERY subscriber hook declares a
resync path (onReconnect) or an explicit reviewed `replaySafe` opt-out, so a new non-resyncing
subscriber cannot be added silently.

Fake timers (the suspend delay is 60s of wall clock) and mocked fetch — no real I/O.

Coverage ratchet. The regressions this file was written for were all the same shape — a subscriber
added with event handlers and no way back to authoritative state — so per-hook cases alone would keep
letting the NEXT one through. Every caller of subscribeSse must declare `onReconnect` or the explicit
`replaySafe` opt-out documented on SseSubscription.
`useAgentLogs.ts` is knowingly absent from the exemptions: if it fails here it needs a resync, not an
exemption.

FNXC:DashboardSSE 2026-07-26-17:25:
CORRECTION to the original ratchet, which scanned `app/hooks/` ONLY and was described as covering
"every subscriber hook". That framing was wrong about what it protected: subscribeSse is not a
hooks-only API. Thirteen COMPONENT files subscribe directly (TaskDetailModal, MailboxModal,
GroupTaskModal, MailboxView, PluginManager, WorkflowNodeEditor, PlanningModeModal, BranchGroupCard,
SettingsModal, MissionManager, command-center/MissionControlPanel, command-center/areas/
SystemControlsArea, AgentDetailView). All comply today, but a NEW non-compliant component subscriber —
precisely the regression this ratchet exists to stop, and precisely how two subscribers slipped through
in the change set that motivated it — was invisible to the scan. The walk is now recursive over both
`app/hooks/` and `app/components/` (nested `command-center/` and `command-center/areas/` included).

The walker itself is guarded: a scan that silently stops finding files would pass with zero offenders,
which is the same silent-incorrectness failure mode the SSE work keeps producing. `scanSubscribers`
therefore returns what it examined and the test below asserts the known nested subscribers were
actually reached. Shape follows the repo's existing static call-site gate,
`packages/engine/src/__tests__/engine-no-blocking-shellout.test.ts`.
