/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8 drift conversion):
Coverage for the column-ROLE helpers extracted from ListView's three copy-pasted id
fallbacks.

WHAT THIS PINS THAT THE INLINE COPIES COULD NOT. The fallback branch — "no resolved
traits, guess from the id" — was unreachable from any test while it lived inline inside
two `handleMove` closures and a `useCallback`. It is also the branch that matters most: it
runs during first paint and for a stranded card, and when it is wrong the failure is
SILENT (a badge that stops appearing, a preserve-progress prompt that stops asking before
a move discards completed steps). Nothing throws.

So both directions are asserted for both helpers: traits win when present, ids are used
only when they are absent, and — the case that would otherwise rot — a resolved column
whose traits say "not pre-implementation" is NOT overridden by an id that happens to be
`todo`. That inversion is what a fourth inline copy would eventually get wrong.

REVERT CHECK, measured: making either helper ignore its flags argument (`return
LEGACY_….has(columnId)`) fails the "traits win" cases; making it ignore the id fallback
(`return Boolean(flags?.intake)`) fails the degraded cases.
