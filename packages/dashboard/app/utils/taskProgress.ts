FNXC:WorkflowSteps 2026-06-25-00:00:
Graph-native workflow steps (plan U3). Optional workflow step status now comes from graph-written
`task.workflowStepResults` entries keyed by node id === enabledWorkflowSteps[i]; top-level workflow nodes can also record explicit `source:"node"` progress for workflows that do not project every stage into `task.steps`. The legacy
`/api/workflow-steps` DB-row name lookup was dropped, so step names resolve from `result.workflowStepName`
with a fallback to the raw id.

Render states (design-lens): the progress model distinguishes
- `pending` (enabled, never started — no `startedAt`)
- `running` (graph node active — `pending` status with a `startedAt` and no `completedAt`)
- `done` (passed)
- `advisory_failure` (non-blocking REVISE — amber, counts as completed; does not block merge)
- `failed` (blocking gate failure — red)
- `skipped`
- `not_run` (terminal and non-blocking, but never painted as a pass)
Disabled optional steps are simply absent from `enabledWorkflowSteps`, so they never appear in the
counter/bar. Recorded workflow-node progress is included independently because it represents an actual graph stage that ran, not a toggle placeholder.

FNXC:WorkflowStepNotRun 2026-08-28-14:13:
The dashboard browser bundle aliases `@fusion/core` to its type-only leaf, unlike dashboard tests.
Keep this fixed reason tuple local and drift-tested against the Node barrel instead of value-importing
core workflow helpers that would pass Vitest and fail the production build.

The workflow-step-derived badge label. Operator surfaces used to render raw engine status tokens
("planning", "needs-replan"), which name ENGINE bookkeeping rather than the stage the card is
actually in — and which no user-authored workflow has any reason to recognize. When a workflow step
is running, its own IR-declared name ("Plan Review", "Code Review") is both truer and workflow-owned,
so it takes precedence over the status vocabulary.

Returns undefined when nothing is running, leaving the status mapping as the fallback. The engine
statuses themselves are unchanged — `needs-replan` remains the graph's durable replan signal; this
only decides what the operator READS.
