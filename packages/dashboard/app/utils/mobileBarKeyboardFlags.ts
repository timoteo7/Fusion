While the soft keyboard is up on mobile, the dashboard must NOT show the executor footer (task counts / Running indicator) and must NOT leave dead space above the keyboard. `footerHidden` drives both: it returns the ExecutorStatusBar null AND drops `.project-content`'s reserved footer+nav padding-bottom, letting the composer sit directly above the keyboard.

This applies to BOTH iOS and Android. Previously `footerHidden` was iOS-only (FN-5707): on Android `interactive-widget=resizes-content` shrinks the layout viewport, so the footer's stacked bottom position was technically "correct" while its reserved stack still rendered as an empty gap. Matching iOS removes both the footer and the gap on Android without hiding the official navigation pill.

FN-5707's original Android concern (stripping nav padding mid-focus could make Android Chrome treat the focused input as moving and dismiss the keyboard) is mitigated because the strip is keyed off `keyboardOpen`, which only flips true AFTER the visualViewport has settled into its keyboard-open size — not during the focus transition.

FNXC:MobileChatKeyboardLayout 2026-09-01-05:36:
The footer bottom reservation is only correct while the nav bar is on screen. Use the nav bar's unsettled-tolerant trigger for the footer collapse on both platforms; otherwise a rendered footer rises with an empty mobile-nav-height and safe-area band beneath it.

Fullscreen mobile drawers own their own visual viewport handling. Treat them like modals for board-layout padding so drawer-local keyboards never shift the underlying board.

  Keyboard focus still collapses the executor footer immediately, but the official pill remains mounted and interactive. `navKeyboardOpen` now marks the period in which its visual-viewport lift may apply; it no longer authorizes an off-screen transform.

  FNXC:MobilePillKeyboard 2026-09-13-11:20:
  Menu focus ends the input-owned keyboard interaction before iOS finishes restoring its visual viewport. Keep only navigation in keyboard-placement mode for that closing interval; footer visibility and reservation remain tied to the immediate focus-owned signals.
