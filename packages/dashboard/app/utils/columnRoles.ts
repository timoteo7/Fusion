FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8 drift conversion):
ONE place that answers "what ROLE does this column play?" when trait metadata may be
missing, replacing three copy-pasted id fallbacks in ListView.

WHY A HELPER AND NOT A BARE TRAIT READ. Trait flags come from the resolved workflow, so
`columnFlagsById` legitimately has no entry in two states:

  1. the pre-load window — the board renders before the workflows fetch resolves;
  2. a stranded card resting in a column its workflow no longer declares.

A bare `flags.intake === true` returns false in both, which is silent degradation rather
than a visible failure: the Planning badge just stops appearing, and a move back into a
pre-implementation lane stops asking whether to preserve step progress — so an operator
loses completed steps with no prompt and no error. That is why the fallback exists and
why deleting it is not the cleanup it looks like.

What was wrong was having the fallback THREE TIMES, inline, as `column === "todo" ||
column === "triage"`. Copies drift, none of them were reachable from a test, and each
read like a lifecycle rule rather than the degraded mode it is. Here it is named, has one
definition, and is covered — including the degraded path itself, which is the part that
never had a test.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-19:00 (fleet phase — completing the pattern, not adding one):
THE MID-FLIGHT AND TERMINAL ROLES THE HELPERS WERE MISSING.

The existing helpers originally covered only intake and hold. Complete, review, and implementation
callers need the same flags-first behavior rather than copied id comparisons.

These are not a new abstraction. They are the SAME one — flags-first, legacy id only as the
documented no-metadata fallback — applied to the roles it did not yet cover. The alternative is
inlining flags-plus-fallback expressions at every call site, which recreates the copy-paste drift
the helpers were created to remove: three inline copies in ListView is what started this file.

Every flag used here is already produced by the trait registry and already passed by callers —
`TaskContextMenuColumnFlags` declares all of them. `ColumnRoleFlags` had only DECLARED the two the
earlier helpers needed, so callers were handing them over and the type was dropping them on the
floor. Widening the interface threads nothing new through any call site.

WHY EACH KEEPS AN ID FALLBACK. `columnFlags` is legitimately absent during first paint and for a card
in a column its workflow no longer declares. A bare trait read returns false there, which is silent
degradation — a Done card stops rendering as complete. Same reasoning recorded at the top of this file.

 *   card is still in Ideas, i.e. still waiting for a human to release it.
 *
 * `manualIntake` is the AUTHORITY — the server-resolved fact that this intake column does not
 * auto-triage — so a renamed board keeps the affordance. Any terminal, executing or review trait
 * vetoes it even when `manualIntake` is somehow also present. The legacy `ideas` id is used ONLY
