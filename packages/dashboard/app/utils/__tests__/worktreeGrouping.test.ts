/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8 drift conversion):
The upcoming-work list must find the HOLD lane by trait, not by the id `todo`.

WHY THIS ONE HID. On the default board the id and the role coincide — U11 gave `todo` the
hold trait — so every existing case here passed and the site looked healthy. Rename the
hold column and the filter matched nothing: the worktree view showed no upcoming work at
all and read as idle. A whole panel silently empty, nothing thrown.

Board resolves the hold ids across ALL workflows on the board (a card in another
workflow's hold lane is still upcoming work); Lane passes nothing and keeps the legacy
fallback, which is why the default case below omits the argument entirely.

REVERT CHECK, measured: dropping the parameter back to `t.column === "todo"` fails the
renamed case with an empty queue.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (PR #2625 review — greptile):
TWO WORKFLOWS, ONE COLUMN NAME, DIFFERENT TRAITS — the case that killed the first design.

My first version passed a board-wide set of hold COLUMN ids. Column ids are namespaced per
workflow, so workflow A can declare `staging` as its hold lane while workflow B declares
`staging` as executing. A unioned id set answers "is `staging` a hold column?" — a question
with no single answer — and every executing card in workflow B would have been listed under
Up Next as waiting work. Confidently wrong, which is worse than the renamed-board emptiness
the change set out to fix.

Keying on TASK id moves the decision to the only place that can make it: the caller, which
knows each task's own workflow. This case is the regression test for that, expressed the way
the helper now sees it — one card in the set, one not, both in a column called `staging`.
