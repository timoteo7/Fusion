Badge suppression list. A suppressed code still computes and stores `task.inReviewStall` — only the
visual affordance is withheld — so the Review tab, run-audit, and self-healing continue to see it.

- `no-worktree-no-merge-confirmed`: never surfaced as a badge.
- `merge-blocker`: ordinary waiting stays quiet; a current failed pre-merge gate overrides suppression.
- `undelivered-replay-step` (FUSI-068): deliberately NOT suppressed. Its generic counterpart
  `merge-blocker` is suppressed because ordinary unfinished work is quiet; this one is the named case
  where a reviewer's request was never delivered to anyone, which is exactly the loss an operator must
  see.

The other codes (transient-merge-status-no-owner, merge-retries-exhausted, non-retryable-provider-error)
still badge — they report genuinely stuck states needing an operator.
