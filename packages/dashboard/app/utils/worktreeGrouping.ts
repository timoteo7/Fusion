  tell those apart and would list every executing card of the second workflow as waiting.
  Only a card's own workflow can answer "is this waiting?", so the caller answers it per task

  THE BUG THIS CLOSES, measured rather than assumed: on the default board the id and the
  role coincide (U11 gave `todo` the hold trait), so this looked healthy. On a board whose
  hold column is renamed the filter matched NOTHING, so the worktree view showed no upcoming
  work at all and read as idle — a whole panel silently empty, with nothing failing.

  Dependency satisfaction below still names terminal ids. That is a separate question from
  the hold role and is left alone deliberately: it needs `complete`/`mergeBlocker`/`archived`
