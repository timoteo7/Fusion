/**
 * Search entries for the Merge section.
 *
 * FNXC:SettingsSearch 2026-07-15-17:35:
 * One entry per descriptor row the section renders, co-located so a setting and its index entry change in the same edit. Labels and help mirror the section's `t()` calls verbatim: the index matches on the copy operators actually read, so a paraphrase here would make search miss the words on screen.
 * This list is short because most of Merge is deliberately still bespoke — "More details" disclosure rows, custom branch/remote dropdowns, and rows whose help interleaves `<code>` fragments. See the FNXC block in MergeSection.tsx for why each stayed. Those settings remain reachable through the section's own `searchableText` in SETTINGS_SECTIONS; they simply have no per-control anchor yet.
 *
 * FNXC:SettingsSearch 2026-07-15-20:30:
 * The GitHub/GitLab auth entries moved to SourceControlSection.search.ts with their controls. Merge no longer renders any forge auth row, so password inputs are no longer among this section's reasons for staying bespoke.
