/**
 * Shared contract for the per-section components the SettingsModal shell composes
 * (U9 / KTD-10).
 *
 * The shell owns ALL persistence: it holds the single merged `form`, the
 * scope-aware save-split (see settings/save-split.ts), null-as-delete, and the
 * changed-only project-write gate. Sections are presentational — they read from
 * `form`/section-specific data and emit edits back through `setForm` (and a few
 * section-scoped setters/handlers). They never call `updateSettings` /
 * `updateGlobalSettings` themselves.
 *
 * This is intentionally a pragmatic prop bag rather than a redesigned state
 * model: it mirrors exactly how the inline JSX read and wrote the modal's local
 * state, so extraction is behavior-preserving. Each section's props interface
 * extends {@link SectionBaseProps} and adds only the slice it needs.
