/**
 * Search entries for the Notifications section.
 *
 * FNXC:SettingsSearch 2026-07-15-17:35:
 * One entry per descriptor row the section renders, co-located so a setting and its index entry change in the same edit. Labels and help mirror the section's `t()` calls verbatim: the index matches on the copy operators actually read, so a paraphrase here would make search miss the words on screen.
 * The section's still-bespoke controls are deliberately absent — they are not descriptor rows, so indexing them would point search at an anchor that does not exist: the ntfy/webhook Enable switches (card headers), the ntfy topic + Advanced disclosure (server URL, access token), the per-event checkbox grids, and the Test notification buttons.
