/**
 * Section -> owned settings keys (+ scope) registry (FN-7506).
 *
 * FNXC:SettingsReset 2026-07-04-00:00:
 * "Reset this menu" in the Settings footer must touch ONLY the active
 * section's own keys, at the correct scope (global vs project), and must
 * never silently reset a section that isn't a simple settings blob. This
 * module is the single source of truth for that mapping so the reset flow
 * and `splitSettingsSave` (save-split.ts) never diverge on which keys belong
 * to which section. Global-section entries are re-exported from
 * `GLOBAL_SECTION_KEYS` in save-split.ts (do not duplicate that list here);
 * this file adds the missing PROJECT-section entries and the shared
 * exclusion list.
 *
 * Design decisions (recorded in the `plan` task document for FN-7506):
 *   1. A key-owning section maps to { scope, keys }. Every key here MUST be a
 *      real member of GLOBAL_SETTINGS_KEYS or PROJECT_SETTINGS_KEYS matching
 *      the declared scope (enforced by section-keys.test.ts).
 *   2. Non-key sections (secrets, global-mcp, mcp, plugins, memory,
 *      authentication, prompts, cli-agents, and the three runtime sections)
 *      are NOT a simple settings blob — they are managed by their own CRUD
 *      flows/routes. They are explicitly EXCLUDED from per-menu reset rather
 *      than silently reset. See EXCLUDED_RESET_SECTIONS below.
 *   3. Reset semantics: GLOBAL keys reset to the canonical
 *      `DEFAULT_GLOBAL_SETTINGS` value (write). PROJECT keys reset via
 *      null-as-delete (write `null`) so an inherited/overridable project
 *      setting reverts to its inherited/default value, matching the existing
 *      null-as-delete convention already used by `splitSettingsSave`.
 *   4. Each key is assigned to exactly ONE canonical owning section per scope,
 *      so every section's reset is scoped to a disjoint key set. A key may
 *      still appear once at each scope when it is genuinely dual-scope (e.g.
 *      `githubTrackingDefaultRepo`); the disjointness guard is per-scope.
 *
 * FNXC:SourceControl 2026-07-15-20:30:
 * Rule 4 used to arbitrate a real UI duplicate rather than a naming overlap:
 * `gitlabEnabled` was rendered and written from BOTH "general" and "merge", so
 * the registry awarded it to "general" to keep reset sets disjoint while the
 * duplicate toggle stayed on screen. Both sections' GitHub/GitLab controls now
 * live in the "source-control"/"source-control-global" pair, which owns those
 * keys outright — the arbitration is no longer needed.

  Every project-scoped GitHub/GitLab key is owned here, by the one section that now renders them all. This entry is what replaced the split ownership the notes above used to describe: `gitlabEnabled`'s toggle was rendered from BOTH "general" and "merge", so the registry had to arbitrarily award the key to "general" to keep the per-section reset sets disjoint — a bookkeeping fix for a UI duplicate. With a single owning section the arbitration is gone.
  `githubTrackingDefaultRepo` also appears in "source-control-global" (GLOBAL_SECTION_KEYS): it is a real dual-scope key, and the disjointness guard is per-scope, so the project row here and the global row there are two different settings, not a duplicate.
