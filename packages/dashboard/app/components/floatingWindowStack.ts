FNXC:FloatingWindow 2026-06-22-21:30:
SHARED floating-utility z-index stack. This is the ONE source of z-index for utility floating modals in the dashboard (FloatingWindow utility callers, the right-dock pop-out, the floating terminal, the floating New Task dialog) so they interoperate in a SINGLE stack instead of each type owning a private counter. Utility windows claim `nextFloatingZ()` on mount/open and again on every panel pointerdown/focus, so the most-recently-interacted utility window is always on top REGARDLESS of type.

FNXC:FloatingWindow 2026-06-22-22:30:
Base band sits at 10100+ — ABOVE the page overlay/popover band (log viewer, workflow-editor modal, selection popover, static fullscreen fallbacks at z 10000-10001) so a utility floating window the user is dragging is never painted over by those. Transient top-right toasts are bumped to 10500 (styles.css) so system feedback still shows above a dragged utility window. The workflow prompt fullscreen overlay is itself a floating utility surface and claims `nextFloatingZ()` when opened, because a static z 10000 fallback is hidden by the workflow editor's full-screen mobile FloatingWindow sheet. The counter is module-level and intentionally monotonic: it only ever climbs, which is fine for a session-length dashboard. All floating overlays are `pointer-events: none` (click-through) so raising panels into this shared band never traps clicks on the page behind them. CRITICAL: every floating modal must be portaled to document.body so this shared z is compared in ONE root stacking context (an inline panel cannot beat siblings outside its own context no matter its z).

FNXC:TaskPopupLayer 2026-09-14-11:35:
Task-detail and Chat work windows are interaction-stack peers: the most recently mounted or engaged peer is on top.

FNXC:FloatingWindowStack 2026-09-14-21:10:
FN-394 merges the former lower task/Chat band into this ONE counter. A newly opened window must appear in
front of every other window whatever its type and whatever placement the others hold (snapped column,
filled work area, or floating), which a permanently lower band made impossible. The task-detail entry
points are kept as named aliases so existing callers and their contracts continue to compile, but there
are no longer two competing counters. `--fusion-max-z` still follows the single ceiling, so the plugin
layer stays above every dashboard-managed window.

FNXC:PluginOverlayLayering 2026-07-23-01:21:
Plugins need a stable layer above every dashboard-managed utility window even though this stack is
session-monotonic and unbounded. Keep `--fusion-max-z` at the 11001 boot floor until this utility
counter exceeds it, then raise the inline root value after each claim. The floor sits one above the
tallest static dashboard overlay — the body-portaled model-combobox dropdown at 11000 — so it
dominates every fixed layer. The lower 220+ task-detail band is intentionally excluded; only
utility claims can grow past the dashboard's static layers.

FN-401: the snap-zone preview claims the TOP of this single stack. It used to be painted inside its own
window's overlay, whose inline `z-index` opens a closed stacking context, so the board or any other window
could cover the very affordance that tells the operator where the window is about to land. As a top claim in
the one shared counter it always paints above the board and above every other window, and `--fusion-max-z`
keeps following the ceiling so the plugin layer remains above the whole dashboard.
