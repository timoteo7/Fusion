FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-23:50:
THE CARD FAN-OUT BADGES READ LEGACY LANE IDS ON A RENAMED BOARD.

`computeBlockerFanoutMap` in core takes four lane options. The dashboard wrapper
(`hooks/useBlockerFanout.ts`) declared and forwarded only `staleHighFanoutAgeThresholdMs`, so core
fell back to `holdColumn: "todo"`, `LEGACY_TERMINAL_COLUMNS` and `BLOCKER_ESCALATION_COLUMNS` for
every dashboard caller. On a board whose lanes are renamed none of those match, so `activeTodoCount`
— the "blocking N tasks" count on the card — comes back ZERO while real cards sit blocked.

WHY THIS TEST DRIVES `Board` RATHER THAN THE HOOK. Testing the wrapper would prove the wrapper
forwards what it is given and say nothing about whether anything gives it — the exact producer/
consumer split that this program's learnings doc records as its fifth failure shape, where a
converted consumer with an unconverted producer passed every instrument. The defect here IS the
producer: `Board` had no supplier for these options. So the assertion runs through the real Board,
the real per-task workflow metadata, and core's real computation.

The cases are DIFFERENTIAL: identical task graphs under two vocabularies whose roles are the same and
only the ids differ. `drafting` collides with no legacy id, so a surviving `"todo"` cannot pass by
luck.
