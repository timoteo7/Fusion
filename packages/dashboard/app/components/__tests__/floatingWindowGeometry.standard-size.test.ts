FN-418 unit contract for the proportional opening cap. A fixed-pixel opening height used to be clamped
straight down to the work area, so any host asking for more than the live band between header and footer
opened at 100% of it. These cases pin the cap itself, the untouched small dialogs, the `minSize` priority,
the degenerate work areas, and the fact that snapping still fills the full area.

FNXC:FloatingWindowGeometry 2026-09-16-05:45:
FN-456 keeps the PURPOSE of that contract — an opening height never fills the work area — but changes the
expected numbers, because the opening height is now derived from the width through the shared 1.43 ratio and
the cap is applied as a scale factor on BOTH axes. Expectations are therefore expressed in terms of
`FLOATING_WINDOW_OPENING_ASPECT_RATIO` and `FLOATING_WINDOW_STANDARD_HEIGHT_RATIO` rather than as literals.
The "width is deliberately untouched" assertion is no longer true for ordinary dialogs — FN-456 replaced that
contract — so it lives on in the `full-view` cases below, where it still holds exactly.

FNXC:FloatingWindowGeometry 2026-09-16-07:38:
FN-460 carries the cap itself by `FLOATING_WINDOW_OPENING_SIZE_SCALE`, so the EFFECTIVE opening height cap is
62% x 1.2 = 74.4% of the live work area. The structural promise is unchanged and still asserted: the opening
height stays strictly below the work area, so a window never fills the band between header and footer. The
`full-view` cases below keep the UNSCALED cap on purpose — that is the tested proof of the FN-456 exemption.
