FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8, completion criterion 3):
EVIDENCE that the converted dashboard surfaces behave on a RENAMED board and on the
MERGED board — stated as an invariance property rather than a pile of per-site cases.

THE CLAIM THE CONVERSION MAKES. After resolving roles from traits, a surface's behaviour
is a function of the column's TRAITS, not of its id. So the test is: hold the traits
fixed, change only the id, and every decision must be identical. That is one assertion
covering every site at once, and it fails for any site that still consults an id — which
per-site cases cannot promise, because a per-site case only proves the site it names.

WHY THIS IS NOT A RESTATEMENT OF THE HELPER TESTS. `columnRoles.test.ts` proves the
helpers answer correctly. It cannot prove the CONSUMERS ask them: a component that kept an
inline id comparison passes every helper test. These cases drive the real consumers —
`buildTaskActionMenuModel` and `isTaskAgentActive`, the predicates behind the actions menu,
the pulsing badge, the row border and the column header's executing count — and compare
their outputs across three lineages that differ only in naming.

THE THREE LINEAGES.
  MERGED   — post-#2515 default: one pre-implementation column, id `todo`, "Planning".
  LEGACY   — the pre-merge shape, id `triage`, same traits.
  RENAMED  — a custom board: `backlog` / `building` / `shipped`, same traits.
An id-sensitive site behaves differently on at least one of the three; a trait-driven one
cannot tell them apart.

REVERT CHECK, measured. Restoring `task.column !== "triage"` in `shouldShowActionsMenu`
fails the actions-menu invariance case (MERGED and RENAMED start showing a menu that
LEGACY suppresses). Restoring the intake-id comparison in `taskActivity`'s planner-lane
check fails the agent-active case the same way. Both were run.
