FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-02:20:
THE DOCK'S `renderTaskCard` IS THE SECOND PRODUCER OF THIS AFFORDANCE, AND IT HAD NO TEST.

#3025 fixed both producers of a dock/plugin-rendered `TaskCard` — `MainContent.renderTaskCard` and
this hook's — so that the card receives `taskColumnFlags` instead of resolving nothing and falling
back to legacy lane ids for every role helper inside it (Revert affordances, progress, the
elapsed-time indicator, the planning badge).

Its test covered `MainContent` only. MEASURED: deleting
`taskColumnFlags={input.columnFlagsByTaskId?.get(task.id)}` from `useRightDockController` left the
whole suite green — `MainContent.graph-popout` 6/6, `RightDock` 33/33, `TaskCard.host-inventory` 1/1.
That PR's own revert-check note says dropping the prop "from either `renderTaskCard`" would show up;
for this producer it did not.

So the pair could silently become a single again, on the producer that draws cards into the right
dock where an operator actually sees them. One affordance with two producers needs two assertions —
the Surface Enumeration rule applies to the coverage, not only to the fix.

Driven through the hook's real `renderTaskCard`, captured off the `renderProps` the controller hands
`RightDock`: that function IS the contract this pins. `RightDock` itself is stubbed so the assertion
cannot fail for unrelated dock plumbing.
