FNXC:UiMetadataApi 2026-07-14-00:00:
`ui-metadata-sync.test.ts` proves the /api/views payload equals the shared view
registry, but the desktop sidebar (LeftSidebarNav) still hand-writes one nav
entry per view with a hardcoded i18n key + registry-derived English fallback.
Nothing there is derived from the same source the sync test compares, so a
registry↔sidebar drift (e.g. renaming a view's `labelKey`) would ship silently.

This test renders LeftSidebarNav with every feature flag enabled and captures
each `t(key, fallback)` call. For every view id the sidebar is contracted to
surface, it asserts the sidebar invoked translation with EXACTLY the registry's
`labelKey` and `label`. That pins the hardcoded keys/fallbacks to the registry:
change a registry entry (or re-hardcode a wrong key in the sidebar) and this
fails. The fallback half is registry-derived in the component already, but the
key half is the real drift risk, and this is the assertion that closes it.
