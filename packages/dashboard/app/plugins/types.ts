  The board's resolved column traits, per task id — so a plugin view that draws its OWN card is not
  forced back onto the legacy ids.

  #3025 fixed the two producers that go through `renderTaskCard`. A plugin that imports `TaskCard`
  directly is a THIRD producer, and it could not be fixed the same way: this context exposed `tasks`
  and nothing about the board's vocabulary, so every role helper inside a plugin-drawn card, and
  every trait predicate a plugin calls, fell back to the literal.

  `Partial<TraitFlags>` rather than the dashboard's `ExecutorColumnFlags`, because this module is
  deliberately importable by external plugin builds and may only reference `@fusion/core` and `react`
  (see the header). The runtime value is the same object either way — the map is built from
  `workflow.columns.find(...).flags`.

  Optional and absent-means-legacy, matching how the host already treats remote rows and off-board
  columns: a consumer degrades to the documented legacy names rather than reading "resolved and
  empty" as "this board has no such lane".
