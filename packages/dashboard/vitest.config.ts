FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-14-17:01:
FN-6454 applied the quarantine deletion ratchet to every dashboard test quarantined on 2026-06-14.
Keep this list empty until a new flaky dashboard test is quarantined with a matching ledger entry.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-16-21:31:
FN-6514 rescued QuickEntryBox before the 2026-06-30 deletion deadline by restoring its mutated jsdom viewport, visibility, and object-URL globals in file teardown.
Keep it out of this exclude list so the broad app backfill lane exercises its aria-expanded regression coverage without quarantine drift.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-16-19:21:
FN-6496 merge verification observed github-tracking-hook fail during the changed-test backfill shard with temp-directory cleanup ENOTEMPTY, then pass on isolated rerun.
Quarantine the cleanup-flaky file under the deletion ratchet rather than changing production or test timing outside the chat-streaming scope.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-17-16:12:
FN-6593 deletes github-tracking-hook under the ratchet because the temp-cleanup ENOTEMPTY flake did not have a non-appeasement root-cause fix in this follow-up.
Keep the ledger entry and exclude removed together; git history remains the archive for this dropped GitHub tracking hook coverage.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-18-06:12:
FN-6633 workspace verification observed unrelated QuickEntryBox focus and chat-routes SSE lifecycle flakes after the targeted chat prompt regression suite passed.
Quarantine the files under the deletion ratchet so this prompt-only chat guidance change does not appease flaky timing/focus behavior.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-18-09:02:
FN-6642 rescued QuickEntryBox after the single-file and full app-backfill lanes passed with the exclude removed.
Keep QuickEntryBox out of this list so focus-restoration coverage remains active instead of deleting useful user-facing behavior coverage.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-18-09:07:
FN-6642 rescued chat-routes by fixing the shared engine mock to return an iterable chat-task-document tool list during broad API lanes.
Keep chat-routes out of this list so SSE lifecycle coverage remains active and the ledger/config stay in lockstep.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-19-03:22:
FN-6690 workspace verification observed session-cross-tab fail only during the broad dashboard API backfill shard with temp-directory cleanup ENOTEMPTY, then pass on isolated rerun.
Quarantine the cleanup-flaky file under the deletion ratchet rather than changing timing or session-locking behavior outside the lazy-view CSS chunk scope.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-19-05:20:
FN-6697 workspace verification observed the QuickEntryBox post-submit focus restoration test fail only in the broad dashboard app backfill shard, then pass on targeted rerun.
Quarantine the focus-timing flake under the deletion ratchet instead of changing unrelated terminal shortcut behavior or appeasing the test.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-19-08:17:
FN-6726 workspace verification observed the WorkflowNodeEditor duplicate-merge-seam template conflict test fail only in the broad components-b shard, then pass on targeted rerun.
Quarantine the concurrency-sensitive workflow editor file under the deletion ratchet instead of changing unrelated template insertion behavior or appeasing the test.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-19-18:12:
FN-6744 rescued WorkflowNodeEditor before the 2026-07-03 deletion deadline by deriving duplicate-fragment seam conflicts from the active workflow IR plus React Flow nodes.
Keep it out of this exclude list so desktop and mobile template guards continue proving duplicate merge seams surface an inline alert with no insertion under components-b shard load.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-19-15:40:
FN-6742 rescued session-cross-tab before the 2026-07-03 deletion ratchet by reproducing ENOTEMPTY in dashboard-api-quality-backfill and fixing the test-owned route/close-callback teardown seam.
Keep it out of this exclude list so loaded API shards keep exercising cross-tab locking, beacon release, stale-lock expiry, SSE summaries, and stale-session cleanup.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-19-16:50:
FN-6743 rescued QuickEntryBox's third quarantine cycle by replacing the ref-gated post-submit focus effect with a resolved-submit focus trigger and broadening desktop/mobile submit coverage.
Keep QuickEntryBox out of this list so the dashboard app lanes exercise Enter, Save, duplicate-confirmed creation, mobile non-focus, and failure-preserves-draft focus invariants.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-21-06:50:
FN-6722 workspace verification observed dev-server-process time out only in the broad dashboard API backfill shard while the isolated file passed immediately. Quarantine the process/timer race under the deletion ratchet instead of widening waits or changing unrelated Command Center behavior.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-21-12:42:
FN-6860 rescued dev-server-process by settling stdout detection and fallback-probe lifecycle work before stop/close/failure teardown, then removed its ledger/config quarantine entry. The same loaded API shard also confirmed FN-6742's session-cross-tab rescue still holds, so its stale ledger-only entry was removed to restore lockstep.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-07-19-18:45:
FN-8394 rescues dev-server-process after its second load-sensitive quarantine.
Its injected child-process and process-tree-signal seams preserve lifecycle,
stdout/URL, fallback-timer, failure, and restart assertions without a real shell
child or filesystem store; keep it out of this exclude list and ledger.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-22-18:05:
FN-6937 verified that FN-6860's claimed session-cross-tab ledger removal had not landed: the file was active because this exclude list was empty, but `test-quarantine.json` still carried the stale 2026-06-19 row. The repeated loaded `dashboard-api-quality-backfill` runs and lock-holder mutation proof confirmed FN-6742's rescue still holds, so remove the orphaned ledger row and keep this list empty to restore ledger↔config lockstep.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-06-25-11:15:
The SQLite-to-PostgreSQL cutover (feature quarantine-sqlite-internals-tests) quarantines dashboard test files that exercise SQLite-only behavior. knowledge-index.test.ts asserts the knowledge_pages schema via PRAGMA table_info and sqlite_master on the SQLite store, with no PostgreSQL equivalent at this layer.

Ledger entries removed from scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json in the same commit.
The array stays empty; add new entries here only with a matching ledger row.

FNXC:DashboardTestQuarantine 2026-07-16-09:00:
FN-8077 removed routes-system.test.ts from this list and the ledger in lockstep. Its test now explicitly advances a fake Date-only clock between CPU samples, so unrelated route clock reads cannot stretch elapsed time under the loaded API lane; assertions and timeout policy are unchanged.
