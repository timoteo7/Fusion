      `task-dependency-mutation.pg.test.ts`: a test pinning an id the board no longer has, which reads as a
      product failure and is a test-maintenance failure.

      `in-progress` keeps this case's ACTUAL subject intact — that a caller-supplied `bypassGuards`/`moveSource`
      is not forwarded — and it is a forward move from `todo`, so the R16 backward-move PR guard stays out of
      the way. The point was never which column.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-08-03-00:35 (added while fixing the red above):

THE PAIRED CASE THE SUITE WAS MISSING: an undeclared column must still be REJECTED.

The red above was a stale target, and the cheapest wrong fix would have been to relax the route's validation
until the old fixture passed again. This pins the behaviour that makes such a "fix" impossible: the route
validates the target against the TASK'S OWN workflow (U12/R2), so a column the board does not declare is a
400 — including `triage`, which the default lineage deleted in #2515.

Without this case, a future worker seeing "Invalid column" in a test failure has no way to tell a stale fixture
from a broken guard, which is exactly the half-hour I just spent.
