Lifecycle POSITION — "is this move backward?" — resolved through `COLUMNS.indexOf(...)`, the
legacy enum. A workflow that renames its lanes returns -1 for both endpoints, and
`isBackwardMoveBlockedByOpenPr` treats a negative index as "cannot tell → allow", so the open-PR
guard silently stopped existing on every custom board rather than rejecting anything. A guard that
never fires does not fail a test.

`ir.columns` is ordered and that order IS the lifecycle order (see the graph entry contract), so
the workflow is the authority. The legacy enum stays as the fallback for an unresolvable or v1
(column-less) IR, which keeps `builtin:coding` — whose column order equals the enum — unchanged.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-27-18:20 (U10 / R8 — greptile P1 on PR #2492):
The workflow is authoritative ONLY when it can place BOTH endpoints. Using its ordering
unconditionally reopened the same hole from the other side: a row still stored in a column the
workflow removed or renamed scores -1, and a negative index means "allow" — so exactly the rows
U11 leaves behind in `todo` could be dragged backward past an open PR.

Two orderings, never mixed. Mixing them would misjudge a workflow that REORDERS legacy ids (its
own order says forward while the enum says backward), so the enum is a fallback for the whole
comparison, not a per-column patch.

Residual, deliberately not papered over: when the source is undeclared AND the target is a
workflow-only id, neither ordering places both and the guard cannot fire. That is NOT a
regression — the previous `COLUMNS.indexOf` scored the custom target -1 and was equally absent.
Closing it needs the guard restated in terms of column TRAITS rather than position, which belongs
with the merge lane's conversion (U9), not with a rendering unit.

The previous shape took `columnsWithFlag(ir, "mergeBlocker")[0] ?? columnsWithFlag(ir,
"humanReview")[0]` — one id. A workflow that splits the two (a merge lane and a separate sign-off
lane) then classified a task in the second as outside review entirely, so comment re-engagement was
suppressed on a card sitting in human review.

I fixed exactly this arity bug for the terminal columns one review round earlier and did not
generalise it. The rule, stated so the next resolver added here does not repeat it a third time:
single id answers "where should this card GO" — a move target must be one column. A SET answers "is

The single-id shape is right for the file's older resolvers, which answer "where should this card

terminal" — a membership question. Same helper name, opposite arity requirement; that is what made

COLUMN REMOVED from the shared constant. It hardcoded `todo`, so drift correction forced
the card there regardless of the workflow's actual rebound column — and then the final
verification (which now compares against `resetColumn`) saw the mismatch and raised the
very 409 "limbo" conflict this change exists to remove. Fixing the check without fixing
the writer just moved the bug.

The column is supplied per call from the resolved rebound column; everything else here is
genuinely column-independent cleanup.

      Attach `awaitingPlanning` for plan-in-place (Todo) cards so the "Queued to plan" / "Ready"
      badge pair names the cap the card is actually waiting on. Same additive, best-effort,
      never-fail-the-board contract as the two enrichments above; the field is omitted (rather than
      `false`) for every other row, so those payloads stay byte-identical.

      Requirement: the badges must agree with the engine. TaskCard could only infer "unplanned" from
      `steps.length === 0`, while triage's todo-discovery and the scheduler's dispatch filter both
      decide from PROMPT.md seed-ness — so a card with a real spec but no parsed steps was labelled
      "Queued to plan" while the scheduler was already treating it as a WIP-slot candidate, and a
      re-seeded card still carrying old steps was labelled "Ready" while triage was about to plan it.
      `isTaskAwaitingPlanning` is the shared predicate, so there is one answer per card.

      Cost: one small file read per Todo row, only on this route (SSE payloads are not enriched —
      TaskCard falls back to its step-count heuristic when the field is absent). Bounded by
      AWAITING_PLANNING_ENRICH_LIMIT and logged when it truncates, so a huge Todo column degrades to
      the heuristic instead of turning a board load into thousands of reads.

        FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-23:10 (converting R8's stated deferral):
        The hold lanes, resolved ONCE PER BOARD LOAD rather than once per card.

        The note this replaces deferred the conversion for a good reason and named the shape the
        fix had to take: "the hold column resolved per WORKFLOW from data the board payload already
        carries, not per task from the store". A per-task resolve is what made the first attempt a
        load-time regression — it read a workflow for every row BEFORE the enrich limit applied, on
        the very path whose comment above exists because unbounded reads here "turn a board load
        into thousands of reads".

        `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles` is the project-scoped shape: ONE `listWorkflowDefinitions()`
        read, independent of task count, returning every column any workflow calls `hold` unioned
        with the legacy `todo`. Measured cost is therefore one extra query per board load — flat,
        not per-row — and the enrich limit still bounds the PROMPT.md reads, which are the expensive
        part and are unchanged.

        Over-inclusion is the safe direction here, deliberately: a card sitting in some other
        workflow's hold lane is annotated with `awaitingPlanning`, which is what a waiting card in a
        waiting lane should show. Under-inclusion is what the literal did — no enrichment at all, no
        error, and a silent fall back to the client's step-count heuristic that this enrichment
        exists to correct.

  FNXC:TaskRevert 2026-07-04-00:00 (FN-7524 mode contract; FN-7547 workspace dispatch; FN-7548 granularity contract):
  POST /tasks/:id/revert — intelligent git-revert for Done/Archived tasks (FN-7523), with an
  AI-undo fallback (FN-7524, foundation for FN-7501), workspace (multi-repo) task support
  (FN-7547), and per-sha revert-commit granularity (FN-7548). Guard rails (enforced here AND in
  the engine service):
    - only done/archived tasks are revertable (400/409 otherwise);
    - autoMerge-off is a needsHuman result, not a forced write, and NEVER triggers the AI fallback
      (leave that for a human / sibling FN-7525 to decide);
    - the source task's column/status is NEVER mutated as a side effect of a revert (git OR AI path).

  Optional request body:
    - `mode?: "git" | "ai" | "auto"` (default `"auto"`; unknown values reject with 400). Semantics:
      - `"git"`  — FN-7523 behavior only; the git result (incl. a conflict/unsupported result) is
        returned as-is and the AI-undo path is NEVER invoked.
      - `"ai"`   — skip git entirely; always take the AI-undo fallback.
      - `"auto"` — attempt git first. A clean/alreadyReverted/needsHuman git result is returned
        unchanged (NO AI task created). A conflicting or unsupported git result falls through to
        the AI-undo fallback.
    - `granularity?: "squash" | "per-sha"` (FN-7548, default `"squash"`) — commit granularity for the
      single-repo git-path revert only; forwarded verbatim to `performTaskRevert`. `"squash"`
      preserves the unchanged FN-7523 single-commit behavior; `"per-sha"` creates one attributed
      revert commit per original sha (see `performTaskRevert`'s per-sha apply path). Ignored when
      `mode` resolves to `"ai"` or the task is a workspace task.

  Response contract is ADDITIVE over FN-7523: `{ mode: "git", clean, revertCommitSha?, revertCommitShas?,
  conflicts?, alreadyReverted?, unsupported?, needsHuman?, reason? }` OR, for workspace tasks (FN-7547),
  `{ mode: "git", clean, workspace: { repos: [{ repo, classification, revertCommitSha?, conflicts?,
  alreadyReverted? }] }, conflicts?: {repo, file, ...}[] }` OR
  `{ mode: "ai", createdTaskId: "FN-YYYY", alreadyOpen?: true }` OR, for a single-repo task under
  `autoMerge:false` (FN-7554), `{ mode: "pr", clean: true, prUrl, prNumber, revertBranch, existingPr? }`
  OR, for a WORKSPACE task under `autoMerge:false` (FN-7577 — additive over FN-7554/FN-7547),
  `{ mode: "pr", clean: true, workspace: { repos: [{ repo, revertBranch, prUrl, prNumber, existingPr? }] } }`
  — one revert PR opened per sub-repo, all-or-nothing at the branch-prep phase
  (`prepareWorkspaceRevertPrBranches`), never force-writing any sub-repo integration branch. The
  AI-undo task is created via `createAiUndoTask` (engine) + `TaskStore.findOpenRevertTaskForSource`
  (core) for the idempotency guard — a second call while an undo task is still open returns the
  SAME `createdTaskId` with `alreadyOpen: true` rather than creating a duplicate.

      the yes-branch is DESTRUCTIVE: it stamps needs-replan AND deletes PROMPT.md.

      Two predicates stood in for it and neither answered it. #2614 resolved the INTAKE column, which
      is right for the merged lineage but wrong wherever intake and the planning column differ. The
      older arm asked `!workflowHasColumn(ir, "triage")`, and MEASURED across all 12 builtins: NOT ONE
      plans in `triage`, while SEVEN still declare that column. So for the five that declare `triage`
      AND run every plan node in `todo` — quick-fix, review-heavy, compound-engineering, design,
      legacy-coding — the predicate was FALSE and a planning/needs-replan card sitting in its own
      planning column was refused outright:
        400 "Task is not in a retryable state (current status: needs-replan)"
      The operator had no button at all on a card parked mid-planning. Verified still live on main
      after #2614: 9 of this file's 14 retry tests fail without the change below.

      The mirror-image fault is destructive rather than obstructive: a workflow that plans anywhere
      other than `todo` had a `todo` card's PROMPT.md deleted for a re-plan nobody asked for.

      Ask the graph directly. `workflowPlansInColumn` recognises planning nodes by the semantic markers
      the builtins carry (`config.seam`, an exact `workflowAction` set) with node ids as a backstop.

      merge-active status ("Task is not in a retryable state (current status: landing)"), so when a
      merger died mid-flight — crash, engine restart, operator SIGTERM — the operator's escape hatch
      was blocked exactly when it was needed, and the only recourse was waiting out self-healing's
      recoverStaleMergingStatus sweep. Observed on FN-8004: a killed merge left `landing` stamped and
      manual Retry 400'd for the full sweep delay.

      `isStaleMergeActiveStatus` and its configured age floor are the SAME inputs that sweep uses, so
      the manual path can never be looser than the automatic one. A genuinely RUNNING merge stays protected: it holds the
      in-process merge lease (activeMergeTaskId) and refreshes `updatedAt` each phase, so it fails
      both staleness checks and Retry still refuses it.

      This feeds `isInReviewRetry` rather than only the gate: a bare gate bypass would fall through
      to the generic retry branch below and move a fully-executed task to `todo`, re-running finished
      work. Routing it through isInReviewRetry lands it on the merge-retry branch (clear status/error,
      reset mergeRetries, STAY in in-review) — identical to what the operator's Retry button does for
      a failed merge. A stale-stamped task that also has incomplete steps still routes to the
