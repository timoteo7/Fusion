# Dashboard API route registrars

`packages/dashboard/src/routes.ts` exports `createApiRoutes(store, options)`. It is an orchestrator: it creates shared context and mounts domain registrars. New endpoints belong in the appropriate module in this directory; do **not** add inline `router.get`, `router.post`, or other `router.*` registrations to `routes.ts`.

## Shared context

Registrars receive `ApiRoutesContext`, built by `createApiRoutesContext()` in `context.ts`, and should use the `ApiRouteRegistrar` contract in `types.ts`. The context supplies project scoping, logging, diagnostics, error normalization, and scoped automation/routine helpers without duplicating server plumbing.

## Registrar module map

The following is the complete top-level registrar map currently imported by `routes.ts`. Most names map directly to `register-*.ts`; `registerMonitorRoutes` is in `monitor-routes.ts`, CLI agent hooks/settings are in `cli-agent-hooks.ts` and `cli-agent-settings.ts`, and integrated routers are in `register-integrated-routers.ts`.

- `registerSettingsMemoryRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerSecretsRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerTaskWorkflowRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerWorkflowRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerPlanningSubtaskRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerChatRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerChatRoomRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerMessagingScriptRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerGitGitHubRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerGitLabRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerFilesTerminalWorkspaceRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerAgentsProjectsNodesRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerPluginsAutomationRoutes` — automation and routine CRUD/manual-run/webhook endpoints plus live SSE streams, and plugin-management endpoints. It preserves the `/plugins/:id` registry pass-through; `createPluginRouter` remains mounted later by `routes.ts` so `/plugins/registry` retains precedence. Its co-located `automation-live-run.ts`, `automation-step-execution.ts`, and `plugin-bundled-runtimes.ts` helpers own replayable output, execution, and bundled-runtime fallback metadata.
- `registerApprovalRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerWorktrunkRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerConfigMcpPiSettingsRoutes` (`register-config-mcp-pi-settings-routes.ts`) — config/MCP/Pi-settings registrar with 7 endpoint registrations: `GET /config`; `GET /mcp/discovered`; `POST /mcp/validate`; `GET /pi-settings`; `PUT /pi-settings`; `POST /pi-settings/packages`; `POST /pi-settings/reinstall-fusion`.
- `registerSystemMaintenanceRoutes` — early-mounted system stats, vitest, maintenance-stamp, and backup routes; distinct from the late `/system/*` Command Center panel registrar.
- `registerModelRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerCustomProviderRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerAuthRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerRuntimeProviderRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.

- `registerDiagnosticsRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerCliAgentHooksRoute` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerCliAgentSettingsRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.

- `registerSettingsSyncInboundRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerSecretsSyncInboundRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerSetupActivityRoutes` — the late activity feed, concurrency, and setup split export from `register-setup-activity-routes.ts`.
- `registerIntegratedDevServerRouter` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerAgentSkillsRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.
- `registerProxyRoutes` — domain registrar mounted by `createApiRoutes`.

`registerFilesTerminalWorkspaceRoutes` is an infrastructure aggregator: it preserves nested `session-diff → file-workspace → terminal` registration order. Its file operation routes stay before generic file wildcards. `registerIntegratedRouters` mounts the missions, ideation, insights, evals, research, experiments, todos, goals, roadmaps, stash-recovery, and branch-group integrated routers; `registerIntegratedDevServerRouter` mounts `/dev-server`.

## Mount sequence (machine-readable)

Express matches in registration order. `create-api-routes-mount-sequence.ts` is the runtime source of truth: its mounter rejects missing, duplicate, or out-of-order top-level mounts during router construction. The test parses the markers and numbered, backtick-wrapped list below; update this list and the exported sequence in the same change.

## Ordering rules

- Specific operation paths precede parameterized and wildcard paths.
- `registerProxyRoutes` is always last; its explicit `/proxy/:nodeId/health`, project, task, project-health, and event paths precede `ALL /proxy/:nodeId/{*splat}` inside the registrar.
- Keep model → auth → usage, the agent core/list → core → runtime chain, and project → node → sync → mesh → discovery → inbound-sync ordering unchanged unless a tested precedence migration requires it.
- Keep integrated routers before project/node routes and the integrated dev-server router before skills and proxy routes.
- Keep plugin management registration ahead of the later `createPluginRouter` mount. Its `/plugins/:id` handler calls `next()` for `registry`, allowing the sub-router's registry route to serve that static path.
- Preserve the file aggregator's session-diff → file-workspace → terminal nesting and its operation-before-wildcard rules.

## Guardrails and verification

Residual inline handlers in `routes.ts` are grandfathered only. `pnpm check:routes-modular` compares their executable registration count to `scripts/lib/routes-modular-baseline.json`; the count may decrease but cannot grow. It runs in local `pretest`/`pretest:full` and blocking PR checks.

`src/routes/__tests__/create-api-routes-mount-order.test.ts` locks sequence pairs, exercises the live runtime mounter, verifies proxy path precedence, and checks this README. Route extractions must run both dashboard typechecking and targeted route tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard typecheck
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard exec vitest run src/routes/__tests__/create-api-routes-mount-order.test.ts --silent=passed-only --reporter=dot
```

## Voice transcription

`registerVoiceRoutes` exposes `GET /voice/status`, `POST`/`DELETE /voice/model`, and dictation
`POST /voice/session`, `POST /voice/transcribe`, and `DELETE /voice/session/:id`. Settings are
resolved per request through `getScopedStore(req)` with project-over-global precedence. Voice is
opt-in: only dictation endpoints require `voiceInput.enabled`; model inspection, download, and
delete remain available while off because the user-scoped model cache is shared by projects.

Audio chunks are base64 raw 16 kHz mono signed-16-bit little-endian PCM. Chunks are ordered,
limited to 1 MiB (2 MiB JSON body), and sessions are project-bound. Active sessions become
60-second closed tombstones on completion, delete, expiry, model removal, or the 16 MiB cap; cap
tombstones return 413 while other closed sessions return 409, then all evict to 404. Repeated
DELETE during the tombstone returns `{ closed:true, alreadyClosed:true }`; unknown and foreign IDs
return 404. Download returns 202 with queued/downloading state; poll status for progress.

`server.ts` excludes only `/api/voice/transcribe` from its global 100 KiB JSON parser so the
route's 2 MiB parser can return JSON 413/400 errors; other routes retain raw-body HMAC capture.
