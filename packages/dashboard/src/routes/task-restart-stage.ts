FNXC:TaskRecoveryVocabulary 2026-08-28-00:38:
Retry is the operator name for this in-place stage restart. The module name and
`RESTART_STAGE_FENCE_REASON` remain stable internal/durable identifiers so already parked cards
with `restart-stage-publishing` are recognized and can safely resume publication.

FNXC:ColumnRestart 2026-08-27-23:23:
Restart publishes task state and a workflow continuation through separate durable writes, so write
ordering alone cannot prevent a dispatcher from observing stale artifacts with a new continuation,
or a discarded row through an old continuation. A durable pause is the publication fence every
existing dispatcher and merge gate already honours: W1 raises it before cancellation and W6 lowers
it only after the successor is armed. Re-read the task after W1 before disposing its runtime owner;
production reads materialize a new row, so the pre-fence validation snapshot cannot prove that the
disposer operates behind the durable fence.

A crash between those writes intentionally leaves `restart-stage-publishing` parked and visible.
No automatic sweep owns this reason; rerunning the operator action reuses the same filter and
replace primitive. PROMPT.md deletion is W4, after the durable plan patch and before arm/unfence,
so neither an unmarked plan nor a freshly replanned prompt can be removed. This route adds no new
run-audit mutation: reset/retry use task log entries and pause lifecycle records already provide
the operator audit trail.

FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-08-28-15:15:
The restart fence uses `isMergeActiveStatus` from
`packages/engine/src/merge/merge-active-status.ts` so every merge phase, including the long-running
AI review phase, shares one definition and cannot drift open. The stale-stamp bypass is unchanged:
an orphaned stamp in any phase remains retryable after the shared liveness and age proof passes.

FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-08-28-15:51:
The initial merge check is only an early refusal; a merger can claim the task before Retry raises
its durable pause. Claim the publication fence with `updateTaskAtomic` and classify the exact
lock-held snapshot with the same active/stale predicate and a fresh in-process lease read before
disposing any runtime or publishing restart artifacts. If that snapshot or lease is merge-active,
restore the prior pause fields and return the same conflict so Retry never interrupts a merger that
won the race. The ordinary `pauseTask` write still follows for admitted retries so pause lifecycle
logging and WIP/review presentation remain unchanged.
