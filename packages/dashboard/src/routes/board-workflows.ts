 * workflow definitions referenced — each carrying its ordered columns, display
 * names, and *resolved trait flags* (archived / hold / complete / wip etc.) so
 * the client can render live lanes and show promote affordances,
 * and pre-check drag adjacency/capacity without a second round-trip.
 *
 * The payload is served by a sibling endpoint (`GET /tasks/board-workflows`)
 * rather than folded into the `/tasks` list response, so the existing task
 * payload stays byte-identical and flag-OFF clients are wholly unaffected
 * (additive-only, KTD-8/R19).

It exists because the distinction is trait CONFIG (`intake` with `autoTriage: false`),
not a trait flag, so it was invisible to every client. The dashboard approximated it as
`intake && column !== "triage"` — a hardcoded id doing the work of a missing fact. That
approximation inverts under U11: the merged Planning column keeps id `todo` and `triage`
is deleted, so `column !== "triage"` becomes vacuously TRUE and a "Start" action would
appear on every planning card. Surfacing the real fact is the fix; renaming the
