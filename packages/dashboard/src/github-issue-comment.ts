/*
FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2 Stage D — why every mutation context in this file is the MARKER):

This module runs UNATTENDED: a poll/reconcile sweep or a lifecycle hook reacting to an external event,
not a request anyone made. There is no session, no run and no acting agent to derive from, and the only
ids in scope name the task being reconciled — attributing to those would produce audit rows claiming a
task reconciled itself, the same false attribution the engine's self-healing sweeps refused in Stage A.

So each write carries the unattributed marker, counted by the U18 census and ratcheted DOWN.
Whether these lanes get a real SYSTEM actor is U13's decision; it is deliberately not made here.

// FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04: one-line import on purpose — the U18 census counts any non-`import`-prefixed line naming the marker, so a multi-line import block would score as debt it is not.

 * Requirement: a task must never receive TWO done comments on the SAME issue. A task can carry both
 * linkages at once — maybeCreateTrackingIssue() ADOPTS a github sourceIssue as githubTracking.issue
 * (github-tracking.ts, `source_issue_linked`), pointing both services at one issue — so with
 * `githubCommentOnDone` on, this service and GitHubTrackingCommentService both commented on it.
 *
 * Suppress THIS service only when the tracking service will provably post to the SAME issue: it owns
 * the richer comment (commit/branch/PR/files/merged + release lines). The two may legitimately target
 * DIFFERENT issues (a tracking issue linked separately from the source issue) — that is two comments
 * on two issues, which is correct and must keep working, so match on identity, never on "both linked".
 *
 * Mirrors the tracking service's own `from === to` no-op guard: on a same-column re-emit the tracking
 * service stays silent, so suppressing here would drop the only comment.

    renamed its complete lane never commented on or closed its GitHub source issues at all: the
    listener returned before reading a single setting, so the feature looked disabled rather than
    broken.

    COMPLETE ONLY, not the landed set. My first pass used `hasTaskLanded` (complete u archived), which
    WIDENED the trigger: on a default board archiving a task would have posted a source-issue comment
    that the literal `to === "done"` never posted. A vocabulary conversion must answer the same
    question under a new name, not a bigger one — and archival is a separate lifecycle event whose
    source-issue behaviour is owned by the tracking commenter, not this one.
