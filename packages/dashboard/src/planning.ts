FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2 Stage D — why every mutation context in this file is the MARKER):

The actor for these writes is the authenticated human on the other end of the HTTP request. That actor
does not exist yet: U9 is the unit that resolves it from the session and threads it through the route
layer. Until then each write says so explicitly with the unattributed marker, which the U18
census counts and ratchets DOWN.

Two things this must NOT become. It is not `BOOTSTRAP_ACTOR_CONTEXT`: that means "written while
identity was off" and is real attribution, so using it here would make an unwired route
indistinguishable from a genuine pre-enablement write and leave U9 with no work list. And it is not a
place to stop at one marker per file — the marker sits at the call site because U9's work is per
handler, and one alias would hide every new unattributed route added between now and then.

U9: replace these with the request's resolved actor. Nothing else about the call sites changes.

FNXC:PlanningRuntimeResolution 2026-07-24-16:20:
Planning sessions must be created through the shared `createResolvedAgentSession` seam that chat, executor, reviewer, merger, and heartbeat already use — NOT through a bare `createFnAgent` call. `createFnAgent` pins the session to the default pi runtime, so a planning selection could never route to a CLI/plugin runtime (claude-local/ACP, grok, omp) that owns its own auth; it always issued a direct HTTPS call to the provider endpoint with a Fusion-resolved key. That divergence is why a subscription/CLI-authenticated operator saw planning fail with a raw-key `401 invalid x-api-key` while every other lane worked. Routing here also emits the `session:runtime-resolved` run-audit event, so planning's resolved runtime and post-transform model pair are finally visible.

Planning has no ambient task or bound agent, so it carries no runtimeHint of its own; `resolveRuntime` falls back to the default pi runtime exactly as before when no plugin runtime claims the purpose. `sessionPurpose: "executor"` matches the role planning already requests for skill selection (`buildSessionSkillContextSync(null, "executor", ...)`) and the purpose chat/QuickChat pass for the same reason.

FNXC:PlanningMode 2026-07-23-14:00:
Planning Mode is a collaborative, user-terminated discovery session, not task triage. Its dedicated prompt must not inherit workflow or assigned-triage execution instructions, because those instructions can turn exploratory responses into executor specifications and child-task directives.

A selected direction is a durable plan-backbone decision: every affected running-plan field must be rebuilt around accumulated selections, then exactly one repository-grounded question must narrow that direction another consequential level. The model may update the running plan but must never infer completion; only the visible Proceed with plan action can make a session terminal.

FNXC:PlanningMode 2026-08-07-03:10:
Planning questions normally need 3–5 materially distinct substantive alternatives; two is not sufficient, and a genuinely useful larger set must survive unchanged. Keep exactly one synthetic Other/write-your-own control separate from model alternatives so it remains the canonical free-text path.
*/
/** Self-contained system prompt for the separate collaborative Planning Mode. */
export const PLANNING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## Collaborative Planning Mode

Help the operator iteratively turn an idea into a clear, useful plan. First investigate relevant repository and active-board context with the available readonly tools, fn_task_list, and fn_task_show when that context can reduce uncertainty. Explore the problem before assuming a solution: identify assumptions, unknowns, constraints, affected surfaces, and meaningful risks. Compare viable approaches and their trade-offs. Discuss decomposition when it clarifies scope, sequencing, ownership, or deliverables, but do not automatically split work or direct the creation of child tasks.

Build an evolving operator-facing plan, not an executor-ready task specification. Focus on intended outcomes, concrete deliverables, alternatives considered, and observable acceptance criteria. Do not produce task-specification bookkeeping or execution-process instructions such as task-size policy, commit guidance, no-code-change caveats, or task-creation directives. Author the operator-facing plan in Markdown: write the description as concise GitHub-flavored Markdown, while the structured change, acceptance, dependency, and deliverable fields become its Markdown sections and lists.

Use a deliberate iterative narrowing loop: analyze → concrete options → operator selection → plan rebuild → one deeper question. When the opener is vague, subjective, preference-based, or symptom-only, inspect the relevant implementation surface before proposing normally 3–5 materially distinct actionable directions grounded in those findings, plus exactly one Other option. Two alternatives are not sufficient; provide more than five when additional directions are genuinely useful. Do not ask a generic clarification question or silently select a direction. Keep the provisional plan honest about unselected alternatives.

After every selected option, multi-selection, or free-text Other answer, treat the choice as a durable decision and rebuild every affected running-plan field around all accumulated decisions. The title, description, proposedChanges, acceptanceCriteria, keyDeliverables, and suggestedRefinements must make the selected direction—not the original vague complaint or an unselected alternative—the central intended outcome. Preserve Other text verbatim as steering. Then inspect the selected direction and relevant repository context and ask exactly one consequential next question that narrows it one level further with concrete, materially distinct options. A refine turn uses the selected or free-text focus to choose that next question. Continue this loop until the operator chooses Proceed with plan. The model never validates or terminates the session. Only the user can validate it through the visible Proceed with plan action.

For every initial, answer, or refine turn respond only with JSON: {"type":"question","data":{"id":"unique-id","type":"single_select|multi_select","question":"...","description":"...","options":[{"id":"option-a","label":"...","description":"...","pros":["..."],"cons":["..."]},{"id":"option-b","label":"...","description":"...","pros":["..."],"cons":["..."]},{"id":"option-c","label":"...","description":"...","pros":["..."],"cons":["..."]},{"id":"other","label":"...","isOther":true}],"runningPlan":{"title":"...","description":"...","proposedChanges":["specific change"],"acceptanceCriteria":["observable outcome"],"suggestedSize":"S|M|L","priority":"normal","suggestedDependencies":[],"keyDeliverables":["concrete work item"],"suggestedRefinements":["next focus 1","next focus 2"]}}}. Include normally 3–5 substantive alternatives in options; this example is illustrative rather than a maximum.

Every turn must include the running-plan fields: only title, description, concrete proposedChanges, observable acceptanceCriteria, suggestedSize, optional priority, suggestedDependencies, concrete keyDeliverables, and concise suggestedRefinements informed by the idea and answers so far. Include every distinct, high-value unresolved refinement area; do not cap the list at three. Never use interview question text as a deliverable. Proceed with plan serializes the plan as plan.md without priority or suggestedRefinements; priority remains a task field. Every question must provide normally 3–5 materially distinct actionable alternatives, each with a non-empty description, pros, and cons, plus exactly one Other/write-your-own option. Never treat two alternatives as sufficient or truncate a genuinely useful larger set. Write every label, option, and Other label in the language of the user's original input. Incorporate free-text Other answers verbatim as steering context for the following question.`;

Reported bug: "AI returned no valid JSON" recurred whenever the Planning UI was left and

duplicated. Root cause: the `activeGenerations.has()` guard is check-then-act across several
awaits (persistSession/ensureSessionAgent) — the ActivePlanningGeneration record only exists
once runGenerationWithTimeout runs. Two overlapping turn entries (re-submitted answer from a
remounted view, racing auto-retries, duplicate start of an existing session) both passed the

agent that the surviving turn was actively prompting, so the surviving turn read an empty
assistant message and failed parse with "AI returned no valid JSON".
Invariant: at most one turn may be admitted per session at any time, enforced SYNCHRONOUSLY
(no await between check and reservation). Every generation entry point (submitResponse,
retrySession, startExistingSession, initializeAgent) must hold a reservation for its full span,
so a concurrent entry is rejected with GenerationInProgressError instead of displacing a
healthy in-flight generation.

FNXC:PlanningModelRehydration 2026-07-24-16:20:
A rebuilt planning agent MUST be given the same provider/model pair the session started on. `ensureSessionAgent` previously passed `undefined, undefined` while still preserving `draftThinkingLevel`, so any rebuild — `/planning/respond`, `/planning/:id/retry`, rewind, or a draft resumed after the in-memory agent was dropped — silently discarded the model selection. `createFnAgent`/`createResolvedAgentSession` forward NO `model` when the pair is incomplete (pi.ts `createSessionWithModel`), so pi-coding-agent then picked its OWN built-in default (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`). For an operator on a custom provider or a CLI/subscription runtime that means the resumed turn hit `api.anthropic.com` with a raw key they never configured and died on `401 invalid x-api-key` — mid-interview, after earlier turns on the correct model had already streamed. That is the exact reported symptom: the first turns work, the resumed turn does not.

Resolution order mirrors the start route (`register-planning-subtask-routes.ts` → `resolvePlanningSettingsModel`): the pair persisted on the draft wins, then the lane's settings-resolved pair. Both halves must be present — a half-set pair is treated as unset, matching the runtime's own pair semantics.

FNXC:PlanningContextCompaction 2026-07-22-22:40:
Long planning interviews accumulate the whole Q/A history in one agent session and can hit the
model's context window mid-interview. Planning previously called session.prompt() raw, so a
context overflow surfaced as a terminal session error — and the auto-retry then replayed the
FULL history into a fresh agent, overflowing again, unrecoverably. Every planning prompt now
routes through the engine's promptWithFallback, which classifies context-limit errors and
recovers via prompt/memory compaction and session.compact() before retrying. Test fakes that
mock @fusion/engine without promptWithFallback fall back to the raw prompt unchanged.

  Reported bug: planning got stuck cycling retry/regeneration after the user had already answered.
  Root cause: session.currentQuestion kept the just-answered question all through the next
  generation, and the SSE stream route's catch-up path re-emits currentQuestion to every fresh
  connection. Each FN-7946 auto-retry opens a fresh SSE connection, so the client was handed the
  already-answered question again, which reset the bounded auto-retry budget and re-showed a
  stale question — an unbounded retry/regenerate loop. Invariant: currentQuestion is only set
  while the session is genuinely awaiting user input; it is cleared the moment an answer is
  accepted (below), on retry (retrySession), and never restored from non-awaiting_input rows
  (buildSessionFromRow). answeredQuestion preserves the legacy 200 response body for the
  generation-error case so the modal's submit path keeps its existing SSE-driven recovery.
