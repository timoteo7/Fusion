FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-13:40 (fleet — inline fallback arms):
DELIBERATE-LITERAL — the no-resolution fallback for the already-converted guards below.

Named sets rather than an inline `=== "done"` arm. Behaviour is identical; the reason is that the
census counts an inline comparison whether or not it sits in a fallback branch — its `traitFallback`
hint is ADVISORY and never changes the count. So a correctly-converted guard with an inline legacy
arm stays on the backlog permanently, and the number stops distinguishing real debt from documented
degraded answers. Same shape as `LEGACY_PLANNER_LANES` and `LEGACY_TERMINAL_COLUMNS`.

    `decideIssueAction` has taken an injectable `classify` since U12/R2, and the header above states the
    defect it fixed: "a user-authored workflow whose terminal column is called something else never closed
    its linked GitHub issue". But this — the ONLY production caller — passed no classifier, so every real
    move fell through to `legacyColumnLifecycleClass` and the described bug was still live. The seam was
    reachable from tests only.

    That is the same shape as this branch's earlier finding on the tracking-comment guard: a conversion
    that reads as done, with the resolved path unreachable in production. The lesson is that adding the
    seam and wiring it are two changes, and only the second one fixes anything.

    ORDER MATTERS, and it is inverted from the original. `decideIssueAction` ran FIRST here, before the
    tracking-enabled check, because comparing two strings is free. Resolving a workflow is not, so the
    cheap property read now short-circuits first and only tracked tasks resolve — the same ordering
    `github-tracking-comments.ts` and its GitLab twin settled on. Behaviour is unchanged for untracked
    tasks: they returned without acting before and still do.

    RESOLUTION FAILURE vs A RESOLVED ABSENCE, the distinction this program keeps paying for (#2731,
    #2733, #2734): `ir === undefined` means the workflow could not be READ, and the legacy ids are the
    only answer available. A resolved IR that declares no complete lane is an ANSWER — moving a card
    somewhere is not "completing" it on a board with no completion lane — so the empty set is used as-is
    rather than falling back to `done`.
    */
    /*
    FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-10:45 (batch-core — the THIRD state):
    The note above draws the right line between "could not read" and "read, and there is no complete
    lane". There is a third case that looks exactly like the second and means the opposite, and this
    classifier was silently on the wrong side of it.

    `synthesizeDefaultColumns` upgrades a v1 graph by emitting every default column with `traits: []`.
    Such a board resolves cleanly, so `ir !== undefined`, and every flag set comes back EMPTY — while
    its `done` column plainly exists and holds finished cards. Treating that as "this board does not
    complete anything" made `decideIssueAction` return null for every transition, so on a v1-upgraded
    board GitHub tracking NEVER closed a source issue. And because the source-issue commenter defers to
    this service whenever tracking targets the same issue, neither of them posted: the completion
    comment disappeared entirely, with nothing logged as an error.

    `declaresAnyLifecycleTrait` separates the two. A workflow that expresses no trait on ANY column has
    not made a statement about its lifecycle and keeps the legacy vocabulary; a v2 board that declares
    traits elsewhere but no complete lane still gets the empty set used as-is, which is the behaviour
    the note above argues for and which remains correct.
