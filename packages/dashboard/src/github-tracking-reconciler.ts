FNXC:Identity 2026-08-09-03:04 (U18/KTD2 Stage D — why every mutation context in this file is the MARKER):

This module runs UNATTENDED: a poll/reconcile sweep or a lifecycle hook reacting to an external event,
not a request anyone made. There is no session, no run and no acting agent to derive from, and the only
ids in scope name the task being reconciled — attributing to those would produce audit rows claiming a
task reconciled itself, the same false attribution the engine's self-healing sweeps refused in Stage A.

So each write carries the unattributed marker, counted by the U18 census and ratcheted DOWN.
Whether these lanes get a real SYSTEM actor is U13's decision; it is deliberately not made here.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-05:10 (fleet phase — the SYNC-FILTER class, decided):
PREFETCH A RESOLVED MAP, then filter synchronously. This is the pattern for every
`.filter((task) => task.column === "<id>")` over a list of OTHER tasks — a shape I flagged across four
files and left unconverted while waiting for a decision that had to be mine.

THE TWO OPTIONS AND WHY THIS ONE. The alternative is making the predicates async, which forces every
caller into `for await` and turns one list comprehension into a sequential walk. Prefetching keeps the
filters synchronous and puts the awaits in one bounded place; it also lets the IR cache do its job, which
is the whole reason `resolveTaskLifecycleColumns` takes a caller-owned one:

  "A self-healing pass over 400 cards spanning three workflows must read three IRs, not 400."

So the cache is shared across the WHOLE reconcile run, not per pass. The three passes in this file each
list the board independently; one cache means the IR is read once per distinct workflow for all of them.
`resolveLifecycleColumns` itself is pure and is not memoized by that cache, so this still costs one cheap
struct build per task — acceptable in a background reconcile, and stated rather than hidden.

WHY CONVERTING `archived` HERE IS NOT THE SPLIT BRAIN #2724 DESCRIBES. That guard covers the archived
gate in `packages/core`, where the same question is answered in TypeScript AND in SQL, so converting one
encoding alone diverges them. This file contains ZERO SQL (measured: no drizzle, no `sql` template, no
eq/ne) and calls `listTasks({ includeArchived: true })` — the SQL half has already been told to include
archived rows, so this filter SELECTS among rows it was handed rather than deciding liveness a second
time. Gate versus consumer is the distinction; a consumer can be converted alone.

WHAT IT COST BEFORE. On a board whose terminal lanes are renamed, every filter here matched nothing, so
the reconciler closed NO GitHub issues and reported `scanned: 0` — a clean-looking pass that did nothing.

  an unbounded board — before slicing to RECONCILE_SCAN_LIMIT, so the prefetch did unbounded work to feed
  a bounded scan. `match` is applied here rather than by the caller precisely so the loop can stop.

  Rows past the cut are left unresolved and absent from the map. That is safe because the only consumers

  The three reconcile passes are INDEPENDENT and each MUST run even when another throws.
  Regression that motivated this: the caller ran all three inside one try/catch with a silent
  swallow, and the fragile PG-backend `reconcileDeletedAndArchived` pass ran first. When it threw
  (e.g. an async-layer/row-hydration failure), the done-task `reconcile()` and source-issue
  `reconcileSourceIssues()` passes never executed — on every sweep, startup and periodic. Net effect:
  the reconcile safety-net closed ZERO GitHub issues while only the live move-handler worked, so any
  task the live path missed (moved to Done before tracking adoption was reflected in the move event,
  or a transient close failure like FN-8066's) kept its linked issue OPEN indefinitely.
  runSweep isolates each pass and surfaces failures via console.warn instead of hiding them, so one
  broken pass can never starve the others and a future breakage is observable rather than silent.

    NOT the split brain #2724 documents, and I checked before converting: that store impl filters on
    `deletedAt IS NOT NULL` AND `githubTracking IS NOT NULL` — it does NOT compare the column to
    'archived', so there is no SQL-side encoding of this question to diverge from.

    REACHABILITY, worth recording: in backend mode this pass returns only SOFT-DELETED rows (its own
    comment says the archived-tasks fallback is a separate AsyncArchiveLineage subsystem, skipped here),
    and `task.deletedAt` is tested FIRST in the stateReason chain below. So the archived arm is
    effectively unreachable in backend mode today. Converted anyway rather than deleted: it is the
    documented FN-5577 done-heuristic, and whether that fallback should be wired here is a separate
    question from what vocabulary it speaks.
