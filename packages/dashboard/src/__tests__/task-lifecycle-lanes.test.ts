"HAS THIS TASK LANDED?" — THE QUESTION THAT PICKS THE DIFF BOUNDARY.

The two diff routes chose between a MERGE-COMMIT diff (finished work, already on the integration
branch) and a LIVE-BRANCH diff by comparing `task.column === "done"`. On a renamed board a landed task
took the live-branch path, so its diff was computed against a branch that had been merged and usually
deleted — an empty or misleading diff for exactly the tasks an operator reviews after the fact.

`landedColumnsForTask` holds that decision, and now lives in `task-lifecycle-lanes.ts` — shared with the
GitHub/GitLab source-issue commenters and the GitLab backfill reconciler, which all asked it separately. Testing the seam rather than the routes is deliberate:
an HTTP fixture over these route registrars starts background work and hangs (measured while
converting `register-git-github.ts`), and mocking git + the GitHub client to get past it is the
mock-the-world shell FN-5048 tells us not to add.

Both roles count as landed, and both fallback directions are pinned, because they fail differently:
an unresolvable workflow and a v1-upgraded one (every synthesized column carries `traits: []`, so the
resolved set is EMPTY even though the columns exist) must BOTH keep the legacy pair. Reading empty as
"this board has no complete lane" would send every pre-v2 project down the live-branch path.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-00:05 (self-audit after #2821's review):

THE RESOLVERS NOBODY WAS TESTING.

#2821's review found a bug that lived entirely in a lane BUILDER while every test drove the guard
that consumed it — injecting a value makes the guard testable and the resolver invisible. Auditing
the helpers I added this session for the same shape found three with no direct coverage at all:
`archivedColumnsForTask`, `wipColumnsForTask`, `preWipColumnsForTask`. Their callers are tested; the
functions themselves were not.

They also shared the defect that review named. Each read `resolved.length > 0 ? resolved : legacyId`,
which conflates a v1 upgrade (traits synthesised empty, so the legacy id is the only vocabulary) with
a v2 board that expresses traits and declares no lane of that role — where falling back onto the
legacy id widens the guard onto a role the board deliberately did not assign.

Each helper is now pinned on all four outcomes: the renamed lane, an untraited legacy NAME, the v1
fallback, and the unresolvable fallback.
