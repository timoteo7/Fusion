/*
FNXC:WorkflowColumns 2026-07-19-2c:10 (U12 / R2 / R11):
The operator-surface half of the cutover: every dashboard/API decision that used to key on the
closed six-id column enum must key on the TASK'S WORKFLOW instead.

These are deliberately pure-function tests over the seams U12 re-keyed, not route integration
tests. The value is in the DECISION (which column, which GitHub state, which label), and pinning it
directly is both faster and harder to fool than asserting through an Express stack whose store stub
would have to fake IR resolution anyway. Route wiring is exercised by the existing
`routes-task-*.test.ts` suites.

The fixture is U11's benchmark IR — the same object its acceptance runner drives — so "the editor
can build it" and "the runner can run it" are statements about ONE artifact, which is what R11 asks
for.
