FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-27-16:40 (U10 / R8):
`BUILTIN_WORKFLOW_COLUMN_LABELS` canonicalises lifecycle column labels for BUILT-IN workflows.
It was applied unconditionally, so it also overwrote a built-in that DELIBERATELY renames a
lifecycle column — `builtin:lead-generation` names `triage` "Lead intake" and the board rendered
it as "Planning". Measured against the built-in IRs in tree: 4 column names were being replaced,
3 by case-only variants ("In progress" -> "In Progress") and 1 by a genuine semantic rename.

The canonical map must therefore be a FALLBACK for a column whose IR name adds nothing (blank,
the raw id, or the same words in different case) — never an override of a name the IR chose.
This is also the mechanism that would clobber U11's Todo->Planning rename.

    survives carrying the label "Planning", and `triage` is gone. This expectation still asserted both a
    `triage: "Planning"` key and a `todo: "Todo"` one, so it described a board that has not shipped since that
    change.

    Same class as the 23 assertions corrected in #2758 and the two in #2720, and the same tell: the failure
    reads like a canonicalisation bug ("expected triage: Planning") when the canonicalisation is right and the
    expectation is stale.

    The invariant this case exists for is unchanged and still asserted: the built-in coding workflow'"'"'s columns
    carry their CANONICAL labels rather than raw ids — which is what the sibling case above contrasts against a
    built-in that deliberately renames one.
