FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-08:45 (#2783 review — coderabbit):
The store parameter is the shape `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` ACTUALLY needs, not `Pick<TaskStore, "getTask">`.

The first version took `getTask` — which none of these helpers call — and cast it through `unknown` to
reach the resolver. That cast was a type lie in the load-bearing direction: it let a caller pass a
partial store with no workflow readers, where every call would throw into the catch and silently
return the legacy answer forever. Typed properly, a store that cannot resolve workflows is a compile
error at the call site instead of a silent permanent fallback at runtime.

ONE ANSWER TO "HAS THIS TASK LANDED?", SHARED BY EVERY DASHBOARD SURFACE THAT ASKS IT.

Several places asked it independently and all compared against the literal `done`, so on a renamed
board they silently stopped firing — source issues were never commented on or closed, and finished
tasks diffed against a branch that had already been merged.

WHICH HELPER EACH CALLER TAKES IS NOT UNIFORM, and the split is deliberate:
  - `landedColumnsForTask` (complete u archived) — the session-diff boundary, where an archived task
    has equally landed and its diff must come from the merge commit.
  - `completeColumnsForTask` (complete only) — the GitHub and GitLab source-issue commenters, the
    GitLab backfill reconciler, and the knowledge refresh. Their originals fired on `done` alone;
    widening them to archival would post comments and close issues the literal never touched. #2783's
    review caught exactly that regression in my first pass.

Five copies of one question is how the halves drift apart (FN-6115 -> FN-6118 -> FN-6123 is the
motivating incident: the same affordance fixed three times because it lived in two components). So
this is the single home, and the callers do nothing but ask it.

MEMBERSHIP over `complete` and `archived`. Both mean landed for these purposes — an archived task is
not un-finished — and a board may declare more than one column carrying either role, so
`columnsWithFlag(...)[0]` would silently ignore the second.

EMPTY MEANS UNEXPRESSED, NOT ABSENT. `synthesizeDefaultColumns` (workflow-ir.ts:158-159) upgrades a v1
graph by emitting every default column with `traits: []`, so a v1-upgraded workflow resolves to an
EMPTY set while its `done` column plainly exists and holds finished cards. Reading empty as "this
board has no complete lane" would stop these surfaces firing on every pre-v2 project — a worse
regression than the one being fixed, and invisible to any v2 fixture. Empty therefore takes the same
legacy fallback as a workflow that cannot be read at all.

COMPLETE ONLY — deliberately narrower than `landedColumnsForTask`, for callers whose contract
excludes archived work rather than merely never encountering it.

The GitLab backfill reconciler is the case: its own FNXC note records that archived tasks live in
`archiveDb` and that the active-task backfill intentionally excludes them, so it must not widen to
the archived role just because the shared helper offers it. Today it lists with
`includeArchived: false` and would see no archived rows either way — but that is an incidental
property of the query, not the contract, and folding the two together would quietly couple them.

ARCHIVED ONLY. Separate from `completeColumnsForTask` because archival is a distinct lifecycle event
with its own consumers: retention cutoffs and live-board eligibility ask "is this card OFF the board",
which a complete-but-not-archived card is not.

The two roles resolve independently and have failed independently before, so they get independent
helpers rather than one flag argument — a caller that wants both asks `landedColumnsForTask`.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-23:55 (batch-core, following #2821's review):
THE EMPTY SET AND THE UNEXPRESSED ONE ARE DIFFERENT, and these three conflated them.

Each read `resolved.length > 0 ? resolved : legacyId`, which is right for a v1 upgrade — every column
emitted with `traits: []`, so the legacy id is the only vocabulary that exists — and wrong for a v2
board that expresses traits and simply declares no lane of that role. There the legacy id is a column
the board may still HAVE without meaning it: a `done` or `archived` column left untraited on purpose.
Falling back onto it widens the guard onto a role the board explicitly did not assign.

`declaresAnyLifecycleTrait` separates the two, matching the shape #2821's review established for
`resolveNodeOverrideLanes`. A board that traits nothing keeps the legacy id; a board that traits
something is taken at its word, including when the answer is "no such lane".

FNXC:TaskRecommendations 2026-08-09-06:06:
An undeclared legacy `archived` id remains a compatibility tombstone even after a workflow adopts
lifecycle traits. Only an explicitly declared untraited `archived` column proves that id is live;
archived-trait lanes remain additive because persisted pre-migration tasks can still use the old id.
