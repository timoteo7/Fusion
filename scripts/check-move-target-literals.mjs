FNXC:MoveTargetLiterals 2026-07-31-17:20 (u12 — #3150's population had no ratchet):

WHAT THIS GUARDS. A `moveTask(id, "in-review")` DESTINATION is a call argument, not a comparison, so
the lifecycle-column census — which parses comparisons — has never counted one. #3150 measured 31 such
targets across four files; they are now 0. Nothing held that at 0, so the population could regrow
silently, which is exactly how the comparison backlog drifted 787 -> 854 while its own gate was
unwired.

WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE COMPARISON BACKLOG. A wrong lane GUARD silently answers "no". A wrong
move TARGET is rejected by `moveTaskInternal` with `TransitionRejectionError: unknown-column`, so on a
board that renamed its review lane, every task finishing implementation THREW instead of reaching
review. Loud, but only at runtime and only on a renamed board — the shape no unit test on the default
board can see.

AST, NOT GREP, and the reason is measured: a comment-naive scan of `self-healing.ts` reports one
remaining hit that is JSDoc prose (`* could call moveTask("in-review")`), and #3150's own SQL count
was 37 by grep against 12 real sites — 25 comments. Comments are not AST nodes, so this cannot
produce that class of false positive in either direction.

ESCAPE HATCH. A leading `DELIBERATE-LITERAL` comment on the enclosing statement exempts a site, for
the #1411 legacy safe-landing path (`recoveryRehome: true`), where the legacy id is the point rather
than an unconverted lane. Marker must be in LEADING comments — the census learned that an inline
marker attaches to the wrong node and is silently ignored.

Report-only by default; `--strict` fails on any change from the baseline, in EITHER direction, so a
drop is re-recorded in the same PR that earns it rather than leaving a stale allowance open.

  FNXC:MoveTargetRatchet 2026-07-31-19:25 (u12 — CAST yes, FALLBACK deliberately no):
  Columns are typed `ColumnId`, so `moveTask(id, "done" as ColumnId)` is the NATURAL spelling wherever
  the parameter is nominally typed. It was invisible until now, which left the gate weakest exactly
  where this codebase is most likely to write a literal.

  `??` / `||` / `&&` are NOT unwrapped, and that is a decision rather than an omission. I added them,
  ran the tree, and they flagged this:

      moveTask(id, (await resolveTaskLifecycleColumns(store, id))?.complete ?? "done", ...)

  which is the fail-soft idiom the whole conversion programme is built on — resolve, and fall back to
  the legacy id when the workflow is unreadable, exactly as the role helpers degrade. A gate that
  demands a DELIBERATE-LITERAL marker on every safe fallback teaches people to sprinkle markers, and a
  marker applied by habit is how the next real literal walks through.

  So the legacy id AFTER `??` is the SAFE shape and stays unflagged; a legacy id as the WHOLE
  destination is the unsafe one and is caught. If a fallback ever needs auditing it wants its own
  report, not this ratchet's exit code.

FN-8657 verified the production population at zero, but a zero-only test cannot prove the ratchet still
sees the throw-causing regression. Keep the AST walk callable with an in-memory fixture so tests prove a
literal destination is counted and that only a leading DELIBERATE-LITERAL can exempt it.

The audit found moveTaskInternal confined to moves.ts, its private enforcement point. We still scan it as
stronger-than-required defense-in-depth and pin that behavior here; external callers would not be invisible.

FN-312 keeps the optionless TaskStore API for operator-compatible legacy callers, so production engine call sites need a separate AST ratchet. The measured baseline may only decrease: every new automatic move must declare moveSource, making lifecycle-direction enforcement and operator logs authoritative without mistaking comments or HTTP operator routes for engine code.
