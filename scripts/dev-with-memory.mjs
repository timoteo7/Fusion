Which port to tunnel is NOT knowable up front. `resolveDevTunnelPort` returns the port the dev
server is asked for, but an occupied port makes the dashboard rebind to an ephemeral one — so with a
normal Fusion already holding 4040, the tunnel pointed at THAT instance and served the wrong app
under a dev-looking URL. Wait for the child's listening report and tunnel the port it actually got.

An explicit `--tunnel=PORT` names a target the operator chose (a Vite server the dev child knows
nothing about), so it is used immediately and never waits. Without one the wrapper WAITS for the
report rather than falling back to the configured port: publishing a guess pointed a dev-looking URL
at whatever else held that port, which is the exact confusion this fix exists to remove.
