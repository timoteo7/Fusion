FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-14:20 (Phase C convergence):
CLI wrapper. The rules, the measured numbers that motivated them, and the reason the three
classes are reported separately live in `scripts/lib/lifecycle-column-census.mjs`; the
regression suite that pins each form this census must catch lives in
`packages/engine/src/__tests__/lifecycle-column-census.test.ts`.

Report-only by default:
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs            # human table
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --json     # machine-readable
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --triage   # split the backlog into flagged vs unexamined
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --compare  # cross-check AST vs text classifier
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --strict   # fail if any file DIVERGES from baseline
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --strict --update-baseline   # re-record after lowering it

`--strict` fails on a RISE (a reintroduced guard) and equally on a DROP that was not recorded: a
stale allowance is a hole through which the same guards can return while the check stays green.

The ratchet runs in the `Lint` job of `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` for pull requests and in the
post-merge `lifecycle-ratchet-drift` job of `.github/workflows/full-suite.yml` for pushes to `main`.
It is intentionally not part of `pnpm test:gate`: that static gate runs only the leading
`node scripts/check-*.mjs` entries from `test:gate:static`, while this command remains an explicit
Lint-job policy check. The per-file baseline makes that check free for files nobody changes, and the
post-merge job prevents main-line drift from being discovered only by an unrelated pull request.

Consequence for conversion PRs, stated because it is a real cost: lowering a count now REQUIRES
re-recording the baseline in the same PR (`--strict --update-baseline`). That is deliberate — it puts
the new number in the diff, where a reviewer sees it, instead of in a hand-written claim.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-14:35 (u12 — the scan root and the READ root could disagree):
`REPO_ROOT` was derived from the SCRIPT's location, while the file list comes from `git ls-files` in
the CWD. Those are the same directory in production and only there. Override the list — which is what
a synthetic-tree fixture must do to stop the suite being a function of the real backlog — and every
path is LISTED relative to the fixture but READ relative to the repo, so each read misses with ENOENT.
Diagnosed by the author of #3228 while trying to build that fixture; the bug is mine, introduced when
I extracted `triageFindings` in #3207 without considering an injected list.

`FUSION_CENSUS_FILE_ROOT` pairs with the existing `FUSION_CENSUS_BASELINE_PATH` seam, and
`FUSION_CENSUS_FILE_LIST` injects the list itself. Both are needed for the fixture: a root with no
list still scans the real tree, and a list with no root still reads from the real one. Production sets
neither, so the default is unchanged.

PARTIAL INJECTION FAILS CLOSED. The two variables are only meaningful together, and the original note
said so without enforcing it — a root with no list scans the REAL tree and reads it from the fixture,
a list with no root lists the fixture and reads it from the repo. Both produce ENOENT or, worse, a
plausible-looking partial census over the wrong file set. This is a fixture-only seam, so a
half-configured run is always a mistake and never a state to degrade through.

  `--others --exclude-standard` adds untracked-but-not-ignored files. It changes nothing in CI (there
  is nothing untracked there) and nothing for the tracked backlog; it only makes the local reading
  agree with the one CI will produce after the commit. Ignored files stay excluded, so build output

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-23:58 (the census says WHERE the work is but not WHO HAS IT):
`--claims` maps each remaining file to the OPEN PRs already touching it, so "claim the largest
cluster" can be answered without discovering the collision at merge time.

WHY. Duplicate claims are now the dominant coordination cost of the fleet phase, and they are
measured, not suspected. `self-healing.ts` took THREE overlapping conversions from different lanes
while one branch was open (#3049, #3075, #3078) — every one forced a full rebuild of #3094, and each
conflict was the same shape: same guard, two spellings, different variable names. On 2026-07-31 the
executor listener took TWO independent conversions in one afternoon (#3112, #3118), reached by two
workers who each read the census, saw the top cluster, and started. Neither could see the other.

The census is what sends everyone to the same file, so the claim signal belongs here rather than in a
side channel nobody reads. `--triage` above already measured the underlying fact — 53 of 88 guards
were inside an open PR — which is the same observation one step short of being actionable.

REPORT-ONLY AND FAIL-SOFT, on the same terms as `--triage`: opt-in, prints beside the totals, changes
no count and no exit code. It shells to `gh`, so it is unavailable offline, in CI without a token, and
in sandboxes — all of which print a NOTICE and continue rather than failing the census. A gate must
not depend on network state, and this is a work-selection aid, not a gate.

HEURISTIC, AND SAID SO. A PR touching a file is not proof it converts THAT file's guards — it may
edit an unrelated function. It over-reports (a claim that is only adjacent) rather than under-reports,
which is the safe direction for "check before you start": the cost of a false claim is one comment
asking, and the cost of a missed one is a rebuilt branch.
*/
/*
FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-23:30 (the headline number stopped tracking work):
`--triage` splits the backlog into sites that carry a DOCUMENTED reason for staying a literal and
sites nobody has examined. Opt-in, printed BESIDE the totals, and it changes no count and no exit
code — same discipline as `traitFallbackCount` above.

Why it exists. A guard deferred on purpose, with the reason written next to it, is not the same work
item as an unexamined literal, and the headline conflates them. Measured by hand across the fleet
phase, repeatedly: of 88 guards at one point, 53 were already inside an open PR, 13 carried an
explicit flag note, 11 were fallback arms, and 11 were genuinely unexamined. A worker told to "claim
the largest cluster" reads 88 and finds 11, then reaches for whatever moves the number — which is how
three PRs converted guards to a synchronous resolver that is inert under PostgreSQL (#3051, refuted
live in #3058; #3062/#3068/#3079 now fail the build on it).

HEURISTIC, AND SAID SO. Classification is comment proximity: an FNXC note within 40 lines above the
guard whose text marks a deliberate deferral. It cannot tell a good reason from a bad one, and a note
far above its guard reads as unflagged. It is a triage aid for choosing work, never a gate — which is
why it is opt-in and why nothing downstream consumes it.
*/
/*
FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-23:51 (the marker list was a guess, and it under-matched):
MEASURED by working the start-here list this flag produces: ALL SIX files it offered carry an explicit
deferral note, in phrasing none of the original markers matched.

  - `moves.ts`                    "THIS ARM STAYS INLINE, deliberately"
  - `mission-store.ts`            "audited — DEAD SYNC PATH, do not convert"
  - `ResearchTaskActionModal.tsx` "SIZED, NOT CONVERTED" / "STILL A LITERAL"
  - `audit-ops.ts`, `async-comments-attachments.ts`, `eval-signal-collector.ts`
                                  defer to `archived-column-gate-parity.test.ts` by name

The cost of missing them is not cosmetic. Five of the six are `packages/core` `archived` sites inside
that parity guard's three-encoding inventory, where converting the TypeScript half ALONE is the
documented split brain. So the start-here list was most confidently offering the one class of
conversion this repo maintains a dedicated ratchet to prevent — an under-matching marker list does not
merely overstate the backlog, it aims a worker at the trap.

WHY PHRASES AND NOT A CASE-INSENSITIVE CATCH-ALL. Adding `i` would let "flagged" match casual prose
anywhere in a 40-line window and quietly reclassify live guards as reviewed, which is the same failure
in the opposite direction. These are the literal phrasings present in the tree, added as evidence
rather than as a net.

`triage.ts:793` ("the arm goes back to the literal, which is honest about being one", restored by
#3126 after #3114 converted it inertly) and `scheduler.ts:1323` ("the second of the two honest
literals ... converting it here would be inert"). Neither phrasing was in the set.

Every entry on a list headed "this is the list to pick work from" was already decided. That is the
harmful direction for this tool and it is not hypothetical: sending a worker at a site whose owner
wrote down why it must not move is the #3108 -> #3114 -> #3126 sequence, which cost three PRs.

Added phrases are specific to declining a conversion ("honest literal", "would be inert"), not generic
words, because over-matching hides real work instead. Verified in both directions below.

  Both classify by RECEIVER, not by the literal. A legacy column id appearing next to a role- or
  status-named receiver is a DIFFERENT DOMAIN that happens to share vocabulary with the old board.
  Measured samples from the current tree:

      outcome === "archived"     packages/cli/src/commands/task.ts          a task OUTCOME
      type    === "done"         .../routes/register-chat-routes.ts         a chat MESSAGE TYPE

      status  === "in-progress"  packages/cli/src/commands/mission.ts       a MISSION's status

  None is a task column, so none has a workflow lane to resolve against. "Converting" a goal's
  `status === "archived"` to a column trait does not remove a legacy id — it asks the wrong object for
  a lane it does not have, and the resulting bug is invisible on the default board for the same reason
  every inert conversion is.

  Why this needs saying where the numbers PRINT rather than only in the classifier: the two counts sit
  directly under the backlog with larger values (12 and 185 against a backlog of 0). A worker told to
  drive a census down, finding the column line at zero, has two bigger numbers in front of them and
  "(not guards)" alone does not explain why they are off-limits. The label states the verdict; this

MIXED VOCABULARY IS THE FLEET'S DOMINANT DEFECT. Four review findings in one day were the same

nothing errors — the endpoint just returns "repaired: 0" and looks converted.

A file where both vocabularies are live is where that can happen, so this reports them. It is a
REVIEW SIGNAL, not a verdict: a partially-converted file is the expected state during a conversion
phase, and this is deliberately report-only for that reason. What it buys is that a reviewer of a
file on this list knows to check the collaborators of anything converted, which is what the repo's
Surface Enumeration rule already asks for and what these four PRs each missed.

    answer different questions ("has someone taken it?" vs "is it takeable?") and only their

MEASURED when added: `scheduler.ts` holds 10 guards fed by its allow-listed sync resolver, all already
subtracted from the backlog by earlier PRs. Two conversions of mine were in this class and only one was
caught — by the ratchet, not by this tool.

A WARNING, not a subtraction: attributing individual guards to the resolver needs dataflow this parser

Measured rather than argued, on the marker in register-task-workflow-routes.ts:

  - a comparison appended to the MARKED assignment itself           -> exempt, and byFile is unchanged
The review's stated mechanism (the marker attaching to the enclosing conditional) does not hold;
the narrower hole does, and it applies to every marker in the codebase rather than just this one.

Pinning it per FILE closes it. An earlier version of this check compared the repo-wide TOTAL, which a
REMOVAL in one marked construct offsets against an ADDITION in another — the total stays flat, the
check passes, and the new guard is invisible to `byFile` too because deliberate findings are excluded
from it (PR #2661 review, greptile P1). Same high-water failure this whole PR is about, one field

one of those raises a file's count by one. So a worker doing the right thing hits a red gate whose only
escape is hand-editing the JSON — which is how a ratchet becomes something people route around instead of
run. Measured on current main: `columnRoles.ts` 0 -> 1 from exactly that shape.

  A DROP TIGHTENS THE BASELINE INSTEAD OF FAILING. The old behaviour failed hard, and the reasoning was sound
  in isolation — a stale allowance is a hole, since those guards can return up to the old count while the
  check stays green. What it missed is that the drop is almost never the author's to fix: eleven files dropped
  during one merge wave, none of those PRs re-recorded, and none of their authors did anything wrong. Measured
  three separate times since CI began gating this (`columnRoles.ts` 0->1, then `executor.ts` twice).

  A PERMANENTLY-RED GATE IS A BIGGER HOLE THAN A STALE ALLOWANCE, because it gets ignored and then nothing is
  guarded at all. So the ceiling now follows the count down automatically and says so, while the RISE check —
  the actual purpose, "no new guards" — still fails hard and untouched.

  THE RESIDUAL, named rather than glossed: in CI the write is discarded with the runner, so the committed
  baseline stays stale until someone commits a tightened one. The exposure is bounded (regrowth only up to the
  old count) and printed on every run, and it is strictly smaller than the exposure from a check people route
  around. `--exact` keeps hard failure for the end state, when the count is meant to be pinned and any
  divergence is a real event.

  A TOUCHED FILE MUST BE RE-RECORDED; AN UNTOUCHED ONE IS AUTO-TIGHTENED.

  The residual named below is real: in CI the tightening write is discarded with the runner, so the
  committed allowance stays stale and a later change can regrow guards up to it while the gate is
  green. Naming that is not closing it.

  This closes it where the regrowth would have to happen. Regrowing a guard means EDITING the file,
  so requiring an exact baseline only for files the change TOUCHES makes the hole unreachable — while
  the case this PR exists for stays green, because those authors did not touch the files that dropped
  (eleven files dropped in one merge wave; none of those authors did anything wrong).

  Falls back to the lenient path when no base ref resolves, so a detached or shallow checkout
  degrades to the previous behaviour rather than failing closed on a git detail.

  REPORT THE TIGHTENING, DO NOT WRITE IT. This branch used to call `writeBaseline()` during a plain
  `--strict` CHECK, so running the gate modified the tree it was checking.

  #3287 measured what that costs on the sibling fnxc gate: every worker who ran it received a
  byte-identical uncommitted diff they had not authored and reasonably committed it — #3283 and
  #3285 are the same `+0/-1`, five minutes apart, by two authors, neither of whom wrote that line.
  The gate wrote it in both checkouts. I hit it here the same way, on my own branch, and started
  looking for where my change had touched the baseline. It had not.

  The tightening itself is right, and the "COMMIT IT" message made the diff explained rather than
  mysterious. Neither fixes the mechanism: a check that writes turns every reader into an author.

  Still computed, still reported loudly, written only under an explicit `--update-baseline` — which
  has its own path above, so a deliberate re-record is unaffected. A plain run stays GREEN rather
  than failing, because guard counts drop on merges the author never touched; failing would redden
  main on someone else's cleanup.
