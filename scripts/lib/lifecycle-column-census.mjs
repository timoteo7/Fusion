FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-14:10 (Phase C convergence — the census, measured):

WHY THIS EXISTS. The workflow-owned-lifecycle program tracks its remaining work by grepping
`=== "triage"`. That number was wrong in both directions and by a wide margin, and both errors
cost real work:

  UNDER-COUNTING BY VOCABULARY. `triage` is ONE of six legacy column ids. Run this census for
  the current numbers; when it was first written it reported 1031 column guards across 1956
  source files — done 313, in-review 217, in-progress 201, archived 177, todo 83, triage 40.
  Every one is the same defect class: a lifecycle decision made by column NAME, which stops
  matching on a renamed board. Driving `triage` alone to zero addresses under 4% of it, and two
  files hold a quarter of the remainder (executor.ts 151, self-healing.ts 136).

  This tool is the authority on those numbers, not this comment: figures written into prose go
  stale silently, which is how a tracked count survived being wrong in three separate ways.

  UNDER-COUNTING BY RECEIVER. A pattern anchored on `column`/`toColumn`/`fromColumn` misses
  guards whose local was named for its role in the function. That is how three real guards in
  `executor.ts` — on `from` and `originColumn` — were absent from the tracked list while the
  card they stranded had its work already complete.

  OVER-COUNTING BY VOCABULARY COLLISION. `role === "triage"` and `agentType === "triage"`
  compare an AGENT ROLE. The planner lane is named `triage` and keeps that name; U11 removed
  only the COLUMN. Ten such sites were counted as un-migrated guards, and the "obvious" fix —
  renaming the role — silently empties the planner's prompt template.

WHAT THIS REPORTS, therefore, is four separate numbers rather than one: COLUMN guards (the real
backlog), ROLE comparisons, STATUS comparisons (step/mission/goal statuses that merely share the
names), and DELIBERATE-LITERAL sites (reviewed, with the reason recorded at the site). The last
three must NOT be converted, and each of them was silently inside the tracked figure.

REPORT-ONLY BY DEFAULT. `--strict` compares against a recorded baseline and fails when the
column-guard count RISES, which is the ratchet shape; it is not wired into the merge gate here,
because a thousand-site backlog cannot be a blocking check on the day it is first measured.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-18:30 (PR #2633 review follow-up):
A STRONGER SIGNAL THAN THE NAME LIST, because the name list is guesswork and was already wrong:
`skill-resolver.ts` compares `sessionPurpose` and `tool-availability.ts` compares `surface`, and
both were scored as column guards until they were found by hand. Names are unbounded.

The AgentRole vocabulary is `triage | executor | reviewer | merger`, and three of those four are
NEVER column ids. So an expression compared against `"executor"`, `"reviewer"` or `"merger"` in the
same neighbourhood is being matched against ROLES, whatever its variable is called. That is
structural rather than nominal, and it generalises to receivers nobody has thought of yet.

`triage` is the only member of both vocabularies, which is the entire reason this census exists.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-20:10 (third colliding vocabulary — measured):
STATUS IS NOT A COLUMN, and this one is big: 182 of the 1030 sites this census first called column
guards compare an ENTITY STATUS. `StepStatus` is `pending | in-progress | done | skipped`; mission
features and goals carry their own `done`/`archived` statuses. So `step.status === "done"`,
`goal.status === "archived"` and `feature.status === "done"` were all counted as un-migrated
lifecycle guards, which inflated `done` (105 of 313) and `in-progress` (49 of 201) enormously.

Converting one of them would be worse than leaving it: asking "which column carries the complete
trait" about a STEP's status is a category error, and the step would stop being recognised as
finished.

Two signals, the same pair used for roles:
  - receiver NAME contains `status` (this is what `step.status` and `goal.status` look like);
  - STRUCTURAL: compared against a status-only value nearby. `pending` and `skipped` are StepStatus
    members and never column ids, so an expression matched against either is a status.
The structural half is what generalises; the name half is what catches the single-comparison sites
where no sibling value appears.
