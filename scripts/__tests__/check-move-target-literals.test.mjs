FNXC:MoveTargetRatchet 2026-07-31-19:35 (u12 — five spellings, three rounds, zero regressions kept):

This gate has missed FIVE destination spellings across three rounds — direct/backtick (#3246),
ternary (#3250), and cast (here) — and every probe was run by hand against a throwaway file and then
thrown away, because the scanner executed on import and there was nowhere to put a test.

The root cause of the repeat is one sentence: the destination is a POSITION, and every fix so far has
enumerated NODE KINDS. A kind list is something the language extends faster than anyone guesses, so
the only durable defence is that each shape someone finds stays found. That is this file.

It pins BOTH directions deliberately. Widening a matcher is where false positives arrive: adding
`??`/`||` unwrapping flagged the fail-soft idiom
`moveTask(id, (await resolveTaskLifecycleColumns(...))?.complete ?? "done")` — the correct pattern the
whole conversion programme rests on — so the negative cases below are load-bearing, not padding.
