## Evidence scope and row accounting

Evidence was re-derived from `main` at **`743dc5f46ea5ebf53ff81ce1a9722ce9ef29d37a`**. The
revision-qualified glob command (`git ls-tree --name-only -r main --
packages/dashboard/app/components | grep -E 'Modal\\.tsx$'`) returned **40** files. Of the named
extras, **2** were not in that glob (`AgentDetailView.tsx`, `WorkflowNodeEditor.tsx`);
`RightDockExpandModal.tsx` matches the glob and appears exactly once.

The required `ArtifactsGallery.tsx` grep found **three distinct viewer pop-outs**—`MediaLightbox`,
`PdfViewer`, and `DocViewer`—which each render through `OverlayShell`; therefore it contributes
**3 rows** (not one vague aggregate row). The deduplicated union source-file set contains 43 files
and the union **row count is 45** (`40 + 2 + 3`).

The revision-qualified FloatingWindow, `useModalResizePersist`, shared-contract, and structural
searches were recorded in the table below. The bespoke pointer/drag/resize search was run across
all 43 union source-file pathspecs, explicitly including `AgentDetailView.tsx`,
`WorkflowNodeEditor.tsx`, and `ArtifactsGallery.tsx`; its positive surface-geometry candidates
were New Task, Right Dock Expand, and Terminal. Matches in other files were inspected and are
internal content controls (for example a sidebar splitter, list reordering, or a nested Files-pane
splitter), not modal move/resize mechanisms.

For every **D** row, the cited structural construct was directly inspected at this revision along
with its imports, handlers, geometry state, and corresponding local styling references. The note
“direct inspection” means no surface-level touch/pointer capture, custom `useDrag`/`useResize`,
drag/resize library, pointer-written window geometry, or CSS `resize` mechanism exists; where a
pointer-token match existed, the note records why it does not move or resize the modal itself.

## Shared migration contract

Migrations use `FloatingWindow` with a stable geometry-persistence key and consume
`isTabletTouchViewport` from `useViewportMode.ts`, never bare `@media (pointer: coarse)`. Effective
move/resize hit targets are at least 44px and marked `data-resize-hit-target="true"`. Phone-class
is **≤767.98px** and tablet-class starts at **768px**; JavaScript and CSS boundaries must stay in
sync. A headerless window using `hideHeader` plus `dragHandleSelector` must put the same hit-target
contract on its resolved delegated handle. `closeOnOutsidePointerDown` defaults **off**, so a
modal intended to dismiss on outside pointer-down must opt in explicitly.

### Canonical close affordance

`ModalCloseButton` is the sole primitive for a true modal-close cross, including delegated
`ViewHeader` and native `FloatingWindow` chrome. Each host still supplies its translated accessible
label, close guard, disabled state, ref, positioning class, and test hook; the primitive supplies
button semantics and the decorative `X`. Search-clear, tag removal, banner dismissal, destructive
remove actions, and Task Detail's mobile **Back** navigation are not modal closure and remain
explicit exemptions. A headerless `FloatingWindow` must delegate exactly one close control to its
content header rather than rendering native and delegated controls together.

| `MissionInterviewModal.tsx` | D | `MissionInterviewModal.tsx:826` `<section className="mission-interview-panel">`; FN-395 removed the `FloatingWindow` host, the `floating-window:mission-interview` geometry key, and the delegated drag handle. | embedded main-content surface (not a modal) | FN-395 | No overlay, no `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`, no move/resize affordance; the panel fills the Missions content region it replaces. | Plan Mission with AI is a main-content destination inside Missions, not a modal layered over the board: it replaces the mission list while open, so movable/resizable window geometry has nothing to float above and would only shrink the interview. |
| `ModelOnboardingModal.tsx` | A | `ModelOnboardingModal.tsx:2438` `<FloatingWindow` | already migrated | FN-8606 core/workflow (done) | Long provider onboarding flow. | — |
| `ModelSelectionModal.tsx` | D | `ModelSelectionModal.tsx:195` `.modal-overlay role="dialog"`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | stays static | FN-8607 agent/onboarding/utility | Compact blocking model choice. | Model selection is a deliberately short, focused choice dialog; persistent movable geometry is unnecessary and risks obscuring the required selection. |
| `NativeShellOnboardingModal.tsx` | D | `NativeShellOnboardingModal.tsx:48` `.modal-overlay`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | migrate → FloatingWindow | FN-8607 agent/onboarding/utility | Native-shell onboarding instructions. | — |
| `NewTaskModal.tsx` | A | FloatingWindow (`new-task`), headerless delegated drag host. | already migrated | FN-8620 | Phone sheet and focus trap remain; `fusion:new-task-modal-size` / `-position` superseded by `fusion:new-task-modal-geometry` (one-time reset). | — |

| `ReportModal.tsx` | D | `ReportModal.tsx:79` `role="dialog" aria-modal`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | stays static | n/a | Short reporting-action dialog. | Reporting is a brief confirmation/input flow; a fixed centered dialog preserves its blocking, one-shot interaction. |
| `ResearchTaskActionModal.tsx` | D | `ResearchTaskActionModal.tsx:57` `.modal-overlay`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | stays static | n/a | Small action confirmation. | The modal is a bounded task-action confirmation, so persistent drag/resize state would be needless interaction cost. |
| `RightDockExpandModal.tsx` | A | FloatingWindow (`right-dock-expand`), headerless delegated drag host. | already migrated | FN-8620 | Dock-origin content remains; legacy size/position pair superseded by `fusion:right-dock-expand-modal-geometry` (one-time reset). | The expanded shell floats while content retains explicit dock-origin `surface: "expand"` behavior. |

| `SettingsSyncConflictModal.tsx` | D | `SettingsSyncConflictModal.tsx:218` `.modal-overlay`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | stays static | n/a | Blocking conflict resolution. | Sync conflict resolution must remain an immediately legible centered blocking decision, not a persisted workspace window. |
| `SetupWizardModal.tsx` | D | `SetupWizardModal.tsx:452` `.modal-overlay role="dialog"`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | migrate → FloatingWindow | FN-8607 agent/onboarding/utility | First-run step chrome and blocking setup. | — |
| `StashConflictModal.tsx` | D | `StashConflictModal.tsx:236` `.modal-overlay role="dialog"`; direct inspection: no geometry mechanism. | stays static | n/a | Blocking git-conflict recovery. | The conflict resolver is an urgent bounded recovery decision; centered static presentation keeps the destructive choices visible. |
| `SubtaskBreakdownModal.tsx` | D | `SubtaskBreakdownModal.tsx:607` `.modal-overlay role="dialog"`; direct inspection: list `draggable` controls reorder subtasks only, not window geometry. | migrate → FloatingWindow | FN-8607 agent/onboarding/utility | Nested subtask drag/reorder; panel itself is static. | — |
| `TaskDetailModal.tsx` | B | `TaskDetailModal.tsx` `<FloatingWindow layer="task-detail">` | already migrated | FN-8619 | Dense tabs and pop-out stacking retained; `task-detail-modal-size` is orphaned for `floating-window:task-detail` (one-time reset). | — |
| `TerminalModal.tsx` | A | Floating mode uses FloatingWindow (`terminal-<project>`), headerless delegated drag host. | already migrated | FN-8620 | Floating legacy pair superseded by `fusion:terminal-float-geometry-<project>` (one-time reset). | FN-409 removed the docked presentation and its pin toggle: the non-mobile terminal is pinned (`below`) by default and that gate is explicit, retaining its top-edge resize / `fusion:terminal-docked-height-<project>` because it owns pinned layout. |
| `WorkflowAddStepModal.tsx` | A | `WorkflowAddStepModal.tsx:144` `<FloatingWindow` | already migrated | FN-8606 core/workflow (done) | Headerless delegated handle. | — |
| `WorkflowNodeEditor.tsx` | n/a | Not a modal. FN-407 removed its floating/modal presentation; it renders only as the embedded `workflows` main-content view (`.workflow-editor-embedded`) with no overlay, no floating window, and no close affordance. | out of scope | FN-407 | The workflow editor is a persistent view reached identically from the sidebar, header, mobile More, a task's **Edit workflow**, and the Settings referral. | Two competing presentations for one surface was the defect FN-407 removed; it retains its own `FloatingWindow` hosts only for the nested create dialog and expanded prompt editor, which are genuine dialogs. |

## Completeness check

The table contains **45 rows**: 40 glob rows, 2 non-glob named-extra rows, and 3 independently
classified `ArtifactsGallery.tsx` viewer rows. `RightDockExpandModal.tsx` occurs once. All class-D
rows provide a concrete structural `file:line` citation plus direct-inspection result; every
`stays static` row has an explicit rationale. FN-8606’s landed core/workflow surfaces are class A
and marked **already migrated**; the remaining FN-8607 assignments match its agent/onboarding/
utility batch, with intentionally static confirmations assigned `n/a` where no migration is due.
