# Test velocity baseline

> Weekly FN-6612 signal-per-second baseline. Measure and report feedback-loop velocity; do **not** add slow tests or wire this report into blocking PR checks. The merge gate remains the existing thin Lint, Typecheck, Build, and Gate path.

## Latest baseline

- Cycle: **2026-W38**
- Captured at: **2026-09-17T22:38:00.094Z**
- Timing snapshot: `scripts/test-timings.json` captured at **2026-08-16T06:04:55.815Z**
- Quarantine ledger: `scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json`

## Metrics

| Metric | Current | Delta vs previous |
|---|---:|---:|
| Merge gate wall-time (`pnpm test:gate`) | 11.4s | -2.6s |
| Boot smoke wall-time (`pnpm smoke:boot`) | 26.1s | +5.7s |
| Changed-only test wall-time (`pnpm test`) | 18.4s | +950ms |
| Quarantine / flake count | 0 | 0 |
| Deletion-due quarantines | 0 | n/a |

## Measurement failures

- None recorded.

## Measurement notes

- **2026-W33** (2026-08-16T06:01:44.671Z): single-sample measurement variance; FN-9144 controlled warm median 9.0s over three samples; see docs/solutions/developer-experience/merge-gate-w33-walltime-regression.md

## Timing snapshot notes

- Timing snapshot is 32 days old; verify slowest-file attribution before treating the table as the current culprit.

## Post to #leads

```text
FN-6612 weekly test velocity: gate 11.4s (-2.6s), boot smoke 26.1s (+5.7s), pnpm test 18.4s (+950ms), quarantine ledger 0 (0). Slowest file: packages/core/src/__tests__/postgres/schema-applier.test.ts at 1m 13s. Deletion-due quarantines: 0.
```

## How to refresh

```bash
pnpm test:velocity -- --measure --write-report
```

In measure mode, the script runs a non-measured `pnpm build` preflight before timing `pnpm test:gate`, `pnpm smoke:boot`, or `pnpm test`. The preflight time is setup only and is excluded from lane metrics; if it fails, the Measurement failures section records `Build preflight (pnpm build)` as the reason. Use `--skip-build-preflight` only when the workspace is already built by CI.

Report-only regeneration is cheap and does not run any suite:

```bash
pnpm test:velocity
```

Add a durable measurement verdict without running a suite:

```bash
pnpm test:velocity -- --note "<text>" [--note-target <capturedAt|ISO-cycle>]
```

Notes are stored on their history entries and rendered from every past annotated cycle, newest first, with no window cap. The baseline document is generated; never hand-edit it.
