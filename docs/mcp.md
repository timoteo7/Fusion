# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

[← Back to docs index](./README.md)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way to attach external tool servers to AI runtimes. Fusion stores trusted MCP server definitions in settings, resolves the effective global/project configuration, materializes any referenced secrets only at use time, and forwards enabled servers to MCP-capable AI lanes so those lanes can use the same operator-approved tools.

<!--

This page is the canonical MCP operator guide. Keep CLI flags, settings keys, validation statuses, and dashboard section names aligned with the shipped MCP code so secret-reference behavior is documented once without duplicating full procedures across adjacent docs.
-->

## Overview

MCP support lets Fusion operators configure external stdio, SSE, or streamable HTTP MCP servers once and make them available to AI sessions that support MCP. Enabled servers are treated as **trusted once configured**: after an operator saves a server definition, Fusion may forward it to supported AI lanes without asking again for each session.

MCP configuration lives in the `mcpServers` settings key at both scopes:

- **Global settings** hold shared MCP declarations.
- **Project settings** hold project-specific declarations.
- Effective resolution is project-over-global by server `name`: global servers load first, same-named project servers replace them, and same-named project servers with `enabled:false` disable the inherited global server.
- The project-level `mcpServers.enabled` flag overrides the global flag when it is set. If the effective flag is false, no MCP servers are active.

Expected outcome: when `mcpServers.enabled` resolves to true and at least one enabled server definition is valid, supported AI runtimes receive the effective server set for new sessions.

## Server definitions and transports

Every server has a unique `name`, an optional per-server `enabled` flag, and exactly one transport:

| Transport | Required fields | Optional sensitive fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stdio` | `command` | `env` | `args` may provide command arguments. |
| `sse` | `url` | `headers` | Uses an SSE endpoint. |
| `streamable-http` | `url` | `headers` | The CLI also accepts `http` as an alias and stores `streamable-http`. |

Definitions use these shapes:

```json
{ "name": "local-tools", "enabled": true, "transport": "stdio", "command": "node", "args": ["server.js"], "env": { "API_KEY": { "secretRef": "sec_...", "scope": "project" } } }
{ "name": "docs-sse", "transport": "sse", "url": "https://example.test/sse", "headers": { "Authorization": { "secretRef": "sec_...", "scope": "global" } } }
{ "name": "docs-http", "transport": "streamable-http", "url": "https://example.test/mcp", "headers": { "Authorization": { "secretRef": "sec_...", "scope": "project" } } }
```

Expected outcome: settings validation accepts only the required fields for the selected transport, rejects duplicate server names within one stored settings array, and rejects plaintext sensitive values.

## Secret references

Fusion never persists raw MCP environment values, header values, or token-like material in settings. Sensitive maps store only Fusion-managed secret references:

```json
{ "secretRef": "sec_...", "scope": "project" }
```

Use `scope: "project"` for secrets stored in the current project and `scope: "global"` for secrets stored in the global secrets database. The plaintext value lives in the encrypted [Secrets](./secrets.md) store, not in `mcpServers`.

Fusion materializes MCP secret references only at the use seam:

- when creating an AI session for an MCP-capable runtime;
- when running a bounded validation/reachability probe;
- when importing plaintext Claude Desktop env/header values and immediately creating Fusion secrets.

<!-- FNXC:McpConfig 2026-06-26-17:06: FN-7078 extended the FN-7077 forwarding invariant to dashboard readonly planning helpers. Configured MCP servers must reach subtask breakdown (stream/retry/triage), text refinement, goal drafting, agent onboarding generation, PR metadata generation, and insight extraction whenever those helpers have a scoped TaskStore; terminal sessions and DB-row chat session creation remain non-agent-runtime surfaces and intentionally receive no MCP payload. -->
MCP-capable AI sessions include Chat, planning, executor/Tasks, heartbeat runs, reviewer/validator/merger lanes, PR-response and PR-conflict merger helpers, manual AI-prompt workflow steps, workflow model nodes, evaluator, cron/automation, mission execution, mission and milestone/slice interviews, agent reflection, and dashboard readonly planning helpers such as subtask breakdown, text refinement/goal drafting, agent onboarding generation, PR metadata generation, and insight extraction. Non-agent runtime surfaces such as terminal sessions and `chatStore.createSession` database row creation do not receive MCP servers.

Expected outcome: API responses, CLI output, settings JSON, exports, and structured logs show secret references or counts/status metadata only; they do not include decrypted env/header values.

## Validation and reachability

The dashboard **Test** control calls `POST /api/mcp/validate` for one server. The route accepts a JSON body with either:

- `name` — resolve a configured server by name in the current project context; or
- `server` / `definition` — validate and probe the supplied server definition.

`timeoutMs` is optional, must be positive, and is capped at 30000 milliseconds. The response is:

```json
{ "status": "valid", "message": "..." }
```

`status` is one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `valid` | The definition resolved, secrets materialized, and the bounded probe reached the server. |
| `unreachable` | The definition resolved, but the probe could not reach the server within the bounded check. |
| `error` | Validation, secret resolution, spawn, fetch, or protocol setup failed. |

Expected outcome: validation returns only `{ status, message? }`; resolved `env` and `headers` values are never returned.

Note: `fn mcp validate` currently validates stored definitions and reports whether they satisfy Fusion's schema. It does not perform the dashboard/API reachability probe.

## Managing servers in the dashboard

1. Open **Settings → Global → MCP Servers** for shared defaults, or **Settings → Project → MCP Servers** for project-specific servers. Expected outcome: the **Global MCP servers** or **Project MCP servers** card appears.
2. Turn on **Enable MCP servers for this scope**. Expected outcome: the current scope's `mcpServers.enabled` draft becomes true; project scope overrides global enablement when saved.
3. Click **Add server**. Choose `stdio`, `SSE`, or `HTTP`, then enter the required `command` or `url`. Expected outcome: the editor only asks for fields used by that transport and saves `HTTP` as `streamable-http`.
4. Add sensitive values under **Environment secret refs** for `stdio` or **Header secret refs** for `sse` / `streamable-http`. Choose an existing secret or create a new secret with **Create secret**. Expected outcome: the settings draft receives only `{ secretRef, scope }`; the plaintext creation value is stored in Secrets, not in settings.
5. Save the server. Expected outcome: the row appears with its transport, state badge, and validation status of **Not tested**.
6. In project settings, review inherited rows from global settings. Use **Override** to replace an inherited server or **Disable** to add a same-named project disabled entry. Expected outcome: state badges identify inherited, overridden, project-local, and disabled-global behavior before you save.
7. Click **Test** on a server row. Expected outcome: the row shows **Testing…** while pending, then `valid`, `unreachable`, or `error` with the returned message.
8. Review **Discovered on this machine**. Expected outcome: Fusion shows read-only MCP servers found in supported third-party config files for this scope, with source labels and a **Configured** badge for same-named servers already present in the current settings draft.
9. Click **Add** for a discovered server you trust. Expected outcome: servers without sensitive fields are copied into the current scope and enable that scope; servers with discovered env/header/token material open the editor so you bind existing Fusion secrets or create new Fusion secrets before saving.
10. Use the **Import** pane to paste JSON or choose **Upload JSON**. Expected outcome: Claude Desktop-style servers are added to the draft, duplicate names are rejected, and plaintext env/header values are converted into newly created Fusion secrets plus secret references.
11. Use **Copy Fusion MCP JSON** and then **Download JSON** when needed. Expected outcome: the export contains Fusion MCP JSON with secret references, and no plaintext secret values.
12. Save the Settings modal. Expected outcome: the selected global or project `mcpServers` settings are persisted and used by subsequent MCP-capable AI sessions.

## Auto-discovering MCP servers

Fusion can scan known on-host MCP configuration files and show inert candidates in **Settings → Global → MCP Servers** and **Settings → Project → MCP Servers**. Discovery is read-only: Fusion does not auto-enable, spawn, validate, connect to, or otherwise execute a discovered server. A discovered server becomes trusted only after an operator clicks **Add**, reviews the definition, binds any required secrets, and saves Settings.

The scanner reads only these well-known paths; missing files are normal and malformed files produce non-fatal notes in the card:

| Tool | Scope | macOS / Linux path | Windows path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Desktop | Global | macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`; Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Claude Code | Global | `~/.claude.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\\.claude.json` |
| Cursor | Global | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\\.cursor\\mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | Global | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\\.codeium\\windsurf\\mcp_config.json` |
| Cursor | Project | `<projectRootDir>/.cursor/mcp.json` | `<projectRootDir>\\.cursor\\mcp.json` |
| VS Code | Project | `<projectRootDir>/.vscode/mcp.json` | `<projectRootDir>\\.vscode\\mcp.json` |

Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf use the Claude-style `{ "mcpServers": { ... } }` shape. VS Code project config can use `{ "servers": { ... } }`; Fusion normalizes it to the same import parser before rendering candidates.

Sensitive discovery follows the same no-plaintext rule as manual import. If a third-party file contains inline environment values, header values, or token-like values, the API response includes only secret descriptor metadata (`field`, `key`, `suggestedKey`, `scope`) and the candidate definition uses Fusion `McpSecretRef` placeholders. The dashboard **Add** flow opens the server editor so operators choose existing Fusion secrets or create new Fusion-managed secrets; the settings blob stores only `{ secretRef, scope }` references.

The dashboard uses this route:

```http
GET /api/mcp/discovered?scope=global|project
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "sources": [{ "id": "vscode-project", "tool": "VS Code", "label": "VS Code project", "scope": "project", "path": "/repo/.vscode/mcp.json" }],
  "servers": [
    {
      "source": { "id": "vscode-project", "tool": "VS Code", "label": "VS Code project", "scope": "project", "path": "/repo/.vscode/mcp.json" },
      "definition": { "name": "docs", "transport": "stdio", "command": "node", "env": { "API_KEY": { "secretRef": "mcp.docs.env.API_KEY", "scope": "project" } } },
      "alreadyConfigured": false,
      "hasPlaintextSecrets": true,
      "secretDescriptors": [{ "field": "env", "key": "API_KEY", "suggestedKey": "mcp.docs.env.API_KEY", "scope": "project" }]
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

Expected outcome: API clients can display candidates, source labels, configured badges, and secret-binding prompts without receiving plaintext secret values.

## Managing servers from the CLI

1. List configured servers:

   ```bash
   fn mcp list [--project <name>] [--json]
   ```

   Expected outcome: Fusion prints global, project, and effective servers with secret summaries such as `project secret`, never decrypted values.

2. Add a stdio server:

   ```bash
   fn mcp add local-tools --scope project --transport stdio --command node --arg server.js --env API_KEY=my-existing-secret --secret-scope project
   ```

   Expected outcome: Fusion resolves `my-existing-secret` by id or key, stores it as `{ secretRef, scope }`, and prints `✓ Added MCP server "local-tools" to project scope`.

3. Add an SSE or streamable HTTP server:

   ```bash
   fn mcp add docs --scope global --transport sse --url https://example.test/sse --header Authorization=docs-token --secret-scope global
   fn mcp add http-docs --scope project --transport http --url https://example.test/mcp --secret-ref docs-token --secret-scope project
   ```

   Expected outcome: `sse` stores an SSE server, `http` is normalized to `streamable-http`, and `--secret-ref` supplies a token-like default secret field when no explicit `--env` or `--header` is present.

4. Create secrets while adding or editing:

   ```bash
   fn mcp add private-docs --scope project --transport streamable-http --url https://example.test/mcp --create-secret-header Authorization=Bearer-token-value
   ```

   Expected outcome: the CLI creates a Fusion secret with a suggested MCP key and persists only the new secret reference in settings.

5. Edit a scoped server:

   ```bash
   fn mcp edit local-tools --scope project --command node --args '["server.js","--verbose"]'
   ```

   Expected outcome: only the selected global or project declaration changes; effective project-over-global behavior is recomputed later by name.

6. Enable or disable a server:

   ```bash
   fn mcp enable local-tools --scope project
   fn mcp disable local-tools --scope project
   ```

   Expected outcome: Fusion flips the selected declaration's `enabled` flag. At project scope, disabling a same-named inherited server masks the global declaration without deleting it.

7. Remove a scoped declaration:

   ```bash
   fn mcp remove local-tools --scope project
   ```

   Expected outcome: the selected declaration is deleted. If you remove a project override, a same-named global server may become effective again.

8. Validate stored definitions:

   ```bash
   fn mcp validate [--scope global|project|effective] [--json]
   ```

   Expected outcome: Fusion reports whether stored definitions satisfy the MCP settings schema. Use the dashboard **Test** control or `POST /api/mcp/validate` for reachability.

## Importing Claude Desktop configuration

1. Prepare a Claude Desktop-style JSON file or paste payload:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "docs": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["server.js"],
         "env": { "API_KEY": "plaintext-from-claude-config" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Expected outcome: Fusion recognizes the `mcpServers` object and maps each entry to a named MCP server.

2. Import from the dashboard by opening **Settings → Global → MCP Servers** or **Settings → Project → MCP Servers**, pasting the JSON into **Import**, or choosing **Upload JSON**, then clicking **Import**. Expected outcome: plaintext env/header values are converted into Fusion secrets with `prompt` access policy and settings receive only secret references.

3. Import from the CLI:

   ```bash
   fn mcp import ./claude_desktop_config.json --scope project --yes
   ```

   Expected outcome: the CLI prints an import summary, creates Fusion secrets for plaintext env/header values, replaces them with secret references, and imports the definitions into the selected scope.

4. Review the imported rows with `fn mcp list` or the dashboard card before saving/applying broader settings changes. Expected outcome: duplicate names are visible, secret fields show as references, and effective project-over-global behavior is clear.

## Exporting Fusion MCP configuration

1. Export from the dashboard by opening the MCP settings card and clicking **Copy Fusion MCP JSON**. Expected outcome: the JSON is copied when clipboard access is available, and the export text appears for manual copy.
2. Click **Download JSON** after generating the dashboard export. Expected outcome: the browser downloads `fusion-mcp-servers.json`.
3. Export from the CLI:

   ```bash
   fn mcp export --scope effective --output fusion-mcp-servers.json
   fn mcp export --scope global --json
   ```

   Expected outcome: `--output` writes the JSON to a file; without `--output`, Fusion prints JSON to stdout. `global`, `project`, and `effective` choose stored global declarations, stored project declarations, or resolved project-over-global output.
4. Inspect the exported secret fields. Expected outcome: env/header values remain `{ secretRef, scope }` references and are not decrypted into plaintext.

## How MCP servers reach AI lanes

When an AI lane or readonly dashboard helper starts a session, Fusion resolves the effective `mcpServers` settings, materializes secret references through the scoped secrets store, and passes the resulting in-memory server declarations to runtimes that support MCP. The forwarding path covers chat/planning, executor, reviewer, validator, merger, workflow model nodes, summarization, evaluator, research, cron/automation, mission, reflection, subtask breakdown, text refinement/goal drafting, agent onboarding generation, PR metadata generation, and insight extraction paths.

Runtime support is guarded. Claude/pi/ACP-compatible runtimes receive MCP servers; mock or unsupported runtimes skip forwarding and emit only structured count/provider/runtime metadata. Skipped forwarding is not a settings error: it means the selected runtime does not accept MCP server declarations.

The default pi runtime connects resolved MCP servers inside the engine because pi does not consume raw `mcpServers` declarations itself. For each reachable server, Fusion performs the MCP handshake, lists tools, and registers each tool as a pi custom tool named `mcp__<server>__<tool>` with sanitized, deterministic suffixes for collisions. A genuine empty or disabled effective configuration creates no MCP tools. By contrast, secret materialization, connection, or tool-listing failure aborts configured session bootstrap with only the server name and a coarse failure category; Fusion never silently turns that failure into an apparently empty catalog and never includes raw exception text or server contents. Every client is tracked before connection and closed exactly once on success, failure, abort, model fallback, approval suspension, or normal session disposal.

Executor, retry, workflow-node, self-fix, child, and unpause-resume sessions resolve the effective project/global MCP set immediately before each new runtime session. Resolution is not cached in task state, and materialized secret values remain in memory only for that session bootstrap.

Namespaced MCP tools remain governed external network actions. When policy requires approval, the first call creates or reuses one pending request, pauses the task/agent, and disposes the active session. Approval and denial use the shared `POST /api/approvals/:id/decision` route on desktop and mobile. If the decision arrives while the old executor is still unwinding, Fusion records one deferred resume and starts it only after the old execution lock and session surfaces are released. The resumed session re-resolves and reconnects MCP before prompting: an approved request permits the matching logical call once and is then marked completed; a denied request makes no MCP call. User-paused tasks remain paused.

### Verifying executor MCP lifecycle

After installing a build with an MCP lifecycle change, use a non-mutating configured tool to verify the runtime rather than relying on settings presence alone:

1. Start three genuinely fresh executor runs and record sanitized run ids/start times.
2. Confirm each actual tool catalog contains the same expected `mcp__<server>__<tool>` name.
3. Invoke one explicitly read-only operation, approve that request through the normal dashboard approval route, and confirm the resumed call returns once and the approval reaches `completed`.
4. Confirm audit evidence contains no other external tool invocation and that no client/session remains active.
5. If any configured server reports `secret-materialization`, `connect`, `list`, `aborted`, or another coarse error category, treat the run as a bootstrap failure. Do not inspect or log the server definition, URL, command arguments, headers, environment, secret values, or raw exception text.

Read-only sessions do not receive MCP tools automatically. Interactive planning and mission interview lanes (planning, streaming planning, mission interview, milestone interview, and slice interview) explicitly opt in because their job is to gather context and create plans, so configured MCP documentation/context tools are available there while still passing through the same custom-tool read-only filter, allowlists, permanent-agent gating, action-gate wrapping, worktree-boundary wrapping, schema preservation, redacted logging, and teardown path. Other read-only validator/helper lanes must make their own reviewed opt-in before external MCP tools appear.

Expected outcome: enabling a server makes it available to subsequent supported AI sessions and explicitly opted-in planning/mission read-only sessions, while unsupported sessions and read-only sessions without the opt-in continue without MCP tools and without logging secret-bearing server definitions.

See [Settings Reference](./settings-reference.md) for the `mcpServers` settings contract and [Agents](./agents.md) for runtime/model lane behavior.

## Fusion memory built-in

When MCP is enabled, Fusion automatically resolves the `fusion-memory` stdio server for project-rooted sessions. It exposes `graph_query`, `graph_neighbors`, and `graph_shortest_path` for the knowledge graph, plus `recall_search` and `recall_append` for durable recall. Graph edges preserve `provenance` (`extracted` or `inferred`) in JSON result text.

The server emits one bounded text block containing `{ tool, results, truncated, omittedCount }`. It drops complete trailing results before using a clearly marked non-JSON fallback. Its cap follows `agentToolOutputMaxChars`; `0` remains unlimited and small configured values are raised to the server's safe minimum. The budget is read from the project store once per MCP process, so restart a session after changing it. If the store is unavailable, graph tools still answer under the default cap and recall tools return an `isError` result. Protocol errors use JSON-RPC errors, while valid tool calls that fail during execution return `isError` so a model can react.

A built CLI entry is required; `FUSION_MEMORY_MCP_ENTRY` can provide an explicit entry for packaged or development installations. A source checkout without a resolvable entry shows the built-in as unavailable rather than breaking MCP resolution.

Disable the built-in with an `enabled: false` MCP entry (a tombstone). Removing that tombstone re-enables it; do not create a normal transport-less server definition. A project marker can cancel a global tombstone without replacing the built-in transport. Lanes without a project store continue to resolve no MCP servers, which is a pre-existing limitation.

## Plugin-provided servers

A plugin can declaratively contribute an MCP server without modifying project settings. Fusion includes it only when that plugin is enabled for the active project, then applies normal project override and `enabled:false` tombstone semantics by name. The server binary remains the consuming project's responsibility; an unavailable command produces the normal isolated MCP spawn failure. Plugin declarations may contain only Fusion secret references for sensitive values.
