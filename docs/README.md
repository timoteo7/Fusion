# Fusion Documentation

[← Back to repository root](../README.md)

Fusion is an AI-orchestrated task board that turns ideas into reviewed, merged code using a structured workflow: **planning → todo → in-progress → in-review → done**.

![Fusion Dashboard Overview](screenshots/dashboard-overview.png)

## Quick Start

Start the local dashboard with `pnpm dev dashboard`, then create your first task from the board or CLI.

For a full walkthrough (installation, onboarding, first task, and daily workflow basics):

### Configuration & Agents
<!--
FNXC:DocsIndex 2026-07-05-00:00:
Planner oversight (FN-7508 → FN-7583) is fully documented in Settings Reference, Dashboard Guide, and Architecture but had no index entry, so it was undiscoverable from the docs hub.

### Audit Reports
<!--
FNXC:DocsIndex 2026-06-15-01:35:
docs/upstream/ artifacts are indexed under Audit Reports for FN-6479 instead of treating docs/upstream/ as an intentional-orphan directory.

FNXC:DocsIndex 2026-06-26-18:42:
FN-7088 links previously-unlinked first-class testing and baseline docs here so the documentation index remains discoverable without changing intentional-orphan conventions such as docs/rfcs/.
