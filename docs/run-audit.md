# Run-Audit Catalogue

The run-audit catalogue for the S4 **Reliability, Durability & Observability** delivery-pipeline theme — a durable, single-source-of-truth reference for *who did what, when, and why after the fact* across the delivery pipeline's reliability/observability event surface.

## Status / purpose

This document is the **run-audit observability catalogue** for the Core Product Vision & Roadmap mission (Mission **M-MSL4E01A-0001-Y9QC**, Milestone **M2 — Roadmap Definition**, Slice **S4 — Reliability, Durability & Observability roadmap**, feature **F-MSL72J0A-000M-GIJN**), **grounded in the M1 vision theme verbatim**:

> "**Reliability, durability, and observability** of the delivery pipeline — tasks, agents, and their delivery are recoverable and inspectable."

See the north-star grounding: [Core Product Roadmap — §4. Reliability, Durability & Observability](./roadmap.md) and [Product Vision — Strategic Themes](./vision.md).

The S4 roadmap near-term item ("Recoverable and inspectable delivery") calls for the pipeline's run-audit behavior to be **inspectable after the fact**. This catalogue is that surface: it centralizes the delivery-pipeline-focus run-audit event names (finalization, self-healing reconciliation, durable-agent error-state) so an operator or agent can answer *"which run-audit events are emitted for delivery-pipeline finalization / durable-agent error-state / self-healing reconciliation, and when?"* without grepping source. It is kept truthful by a parity test that enforces lock-step with the typed catalogue module.

## How to read / query the run-audit surface

Run-audit events are captured via the run-audit store using the discriminated event union type `DatabaseMutationType` in the engine ([`packages/engine/src/util/run-audit.ts`](../packages/engine/src/util/run-audit.ts)). Metadata follows the **ids/outcomes-only** convention — never description prose. All events named below are literal members of that union; the typed catalogue array [`packages/engine/src/run-audit/run-audit-catalogue.ts`](../packages/engine/src/run-audit/run-audit-catalogue.ts) enforces member-validity at compile time, and the parity test (`run-audit-catalogue.test.ts`) keeps this doc and the module in lock-step so neither can drift from the real union.

Query the stored surface through the audit-store read path (project-scoped historical record of emitted mutation events) filtering by the `mutationType` names below and the ids/outcomes-only structured metadata each event records. This catalogue documents *what each event means*; the audit store records *when each was emitted* in a project's history.

## Delivery-pipeline finalization

Events that close a task's delivery: blocked/advanced completion parks, already-merged / already-on-main no-ops, finalize column-mismatch reconciliation, post-finalize verification, finalize-blocking guards, and stale-merger recovery.

| Event | What it records / when it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `task:completed-blocked-parked` | A fully implemented task is parked instead of advancing to review because a live completion blocker applies. |
| `task:completed-blocked-advanced` | The parked completed task's blocker cleared and its work advances to review. |
| `task:auto-recover-already-merged` | Self-healing finds a task already merged into main and records the no-recovery-needed outcome. |
| `task:auto-recover-finalize-already-on-main` | A finalize attempt is skipped because the task's changes are already present on main. |
| `task:auto-merge-skipped-already-done` | Auto-merge is skipped because the task is already done/landed. |
| `task:auto-merge-finalize-column-mismatch-reconciled` | Finalize found the task in a different live column than its target and reconciled the column. |
| `task:auto-merge-finalize-column-mismatch-no-action` | Finalize found a column mismatch but took no action (e.g. blocked/no-action per triple-proof). |
| `task:post-finalize-verification-no-op` | Post-finalize verification ran and found nothing to verify (no-op), recording the check outcome. |
| `task:no-commits-finalize-blocked-incomplete-steps` | Finalize is blocked for a zero-commit task with incomplete workflow steps (FN-6461 lane). |
| `task:empty-merge-finalize-blocked-no-landed-proof` | The AI empty-merge lane vetoes a zero-diff no-op finalize with no landed proof (FN-8141). |
| `task:finalize-unproven-blocked` | Finalize is blocked because finalization has not been proven against the landing truth. |
| `task:merge-boundary-unproven-parked` | A workflow merge boundary could not be proven and its terminal park is recorded with best-effort, time-bounded telemetry that never blocks or stalls the park. |
| `task:merge-boundary-evidence-recovered` | Self-healing reverified durable unfinished work on a historic proofless boundary park and resumed named implementation remediation. Metadata contains task ID and a fixed outcome only. |
| `task:finalize-lost-work-blocked` | Finalize is blocked because it would discard work (lost-work guard). |
| `task:auto-recover-stale-merger-status` | Self-healing clears a stale merger status left on a finalize path. |
| `task:merge-admission-deferred-live-execution` | Merge admission found a live executor session, execution lock, or active task signal and deferred without parking the task. Metadata contains task ID plus fixed source, signal, and outcome values only. |
| `task:reconcile-confirmed-merge-checklist` | A confirmed merge reconciled stale non-terminal checklist steps or pending pre-merge results before terminal finalization. Metadata contains task ID, source, counts, prior column, and fixed outcome only. |

## Self-healing reconciliation events

Reconciliation-scoped auto-recover/reclaim events the self-healing sweep surfaces when it repairs board state after the fact.

| Event | What it records / when it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `task:auto-recover-paused-abort-park` | Self-healing clears a benign pause-abort operator park and requeues the task. |
| `task:auto-rebound-paused-scope-decay` | Self-healing rebounds a task whose paused scope decayed past its floor, unblocking followers. |
| `task:auto-archive-failure-budget-exhausted` | Self-healing abandons a repeatedly failing stale-task archive and surfaces it for operator action. |
| `task:reclaim-phantom-executor-binding` | Self-healing proves an in-memory executor-active binding is stale and requeues the task. |
| `task:reconcile-orphaned-pending-step-results` | Self-healing rewrites orphaned `pending` workflow-step results (no live session) to `failed`. |
| `task:reconcile-unproven-review-approval` | Self-healing rewrites singular content-review approvals without input proof to recoverable `failed` results. |
| `task:reconcile-stale-duplicate-decision` | Self-healing clears a recurring duplicate-decision pause with no canonical target. |
| `task:reconcile-stale-agent-assignment` | Self-healing clears stale durable Agent.taskId/state drift while preserving file-scope leases. |
| `task:reconcile-engine-downtime-active-timing` | Self-healing shifts active-task anchors to exclude proven stopped-engine wall-clock. |
| `task:reconcile-engine-downtime-active-timing-no-action` | Self-healing finds no active task qualifies for downtime-timing reconciliation (no-action). |
| `task:reconcile-undeclared-column` | Self-healing re-homes a row out of a column its workflow no longer declares. |
| `task:reconcile-wedged-active-merge` | Self-healing reclaims a wedged single-flight merge entry. |
| `task:reconcile-stranded-completed-no-action` | A stranded-completed promoter withholds promotion of an all-steps-done/skipped task with a failure-park provenance (no-action). |
| `task:reconcile-legacy-adoption` | Self-healing startup adopts a pre-cutover legacy task row through the KTD-8 adoption table. |

## Durable-agent error-state

Events that make durable-agent error states and their recovery inspectable.

| Event | What it records / when it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `agent:auto-recover-error-state` | A recoverable, non-operator-actionable durable-agent error is cleared by the heartbeat/self-healing sweep and retried. |
| `agent:reset-error-state-on-startup` | An engine restart clears an eligible durable-agent error/exhaustion park and re-arms the heartbeat (startup-only). |
| `agent:error-retry-exhausted` | A durable-agent error retry budget is exhausted and the agent is parked `paused` with pauseReason `error-retry-exhausted`. |
| `agent:error-parked-unrecoverable` | An operator-actionable durable-agent error parks the agent `paused` with pauseReason `error-unrecoverable` for human repair. |
| `agent:heartbeat-move-skipped-soft-delete` | A heartbeat move races a soft-deleted task and is skipped without parking the durable agent. |

## Maintenance contract

Adding a new catalogued run-audit event requires updating **both** the typed catalogue module (`packages/engine/src/run-audit/run-audit-catalogue.ts`) **and** this doc together — the parity test (`packages/engine/src/__tests__/run-audit-catalogue.test.ts`) fails if the documented event set and the catalogue module's set ever diverge, keeping the observability surface truthful as the real `DatabaseMutationType` union evolves. Removing an event likewise requires updating both in the same change.

### Emit-seam policy

All engine telemetry must use `emitBoundedRunAudit` from `packages/engine/src/util/emit-bounded-run-audit.ts`. It is best-effort and never load-bearing for lifecycle correctness: absent/non-function, synchronously throwing, rejecting, never-settling, and late-settling sinks are absorbed without altering the owning branch. The seam swallow-logs and bounds each write; it intentionally adds no retry, backoff, or queueing.

This applies to executor, run-auditor, self-healing, merger, PR reconciliation, scheduler, project-engine, plugin, mission-loop, hold-release, goal diagnostics, overseer advisor, mesh-lease, in-process runtime, credential rotation, and workflow-column-boundary emitters. `packages/engine/src/merge/merge-write-fence.ts` retains its bespoke non-`RunAuditEventInput` recorder. New engine emitters must ship with a behavioral sink-health regression covering hostile sink states, not only a source-routing assertion.

### Core emit-seam policy

Core best-effort emitters use `packages/core/src/run-audit/emit-bounded-run-audit.ts`. This is a deliberate copy of the engine seam because `@fusion/core` cannot import `@fusion/engine`; it synchronously invokes a valid sink, then absorbs throws, rejection, timeout, and late settlement without making telemetry lifecycle-load-bearing. `emitBoundedRunAudit` is the default void seam. `emitBoundedRunAuditWithOutcome` returns `recorded`, `absent`, `failed` (with the original error), or `timed-out` where a forensic throw ordering or caller-visible skipped payload depends on the audit result; workflow-switch torn reconciliation and phantom committed-reservation reconciliation use it. FN-9181 applies FN-9178's class-A decision to detached recall capture: `memory:capture-recorded` and `memory:capture-failed` are bounded, while the injectable `deps.audit` adapter remains a test seam with its existing bare-metadata contract. Transactional writers and explicitly awaited durability/ordering writers remain unbounded. `packages/core/src/__tests__/core-run-audit-sink-health.test.ts` and `core-run-audit-emitter-isolation.test.ts` respectively enforce hostile-sink behavior and source routing.

### Awaited core exclusion decision

FN-9178 classified awaited sites with hostile-sink characterization tests. FN-9180 routed the class-A `task-deleted-outbox:catch-up`, `:reconciliation-fallback`, `:lease-fenced`, and `:retention-pruned` rows through `emitBoundedRunAudit`; each remains awaited at its post-acknowledgement, post-cursor, or post-DELETE position so bounded telemetry preserves ordering. FN-9181 routed detached recall capture through the same bounded seam. `task:workflow-switch-torn` and `task:reconcile-phantom-committed-reservation` are class B and use the bounded outcome seam because their throw/result payload depends on audit outcome. `task:bypass-review`, `task:resume-step`, and both resurrection-blocked records are class C and intentionally unbounded: they claim persistence before return, destructive cleanup, or a forensic throw.

All `recordRunAuditEventWithinTransaction(tx, ...)` calls and the `recordRunAuditEventBackend(tx, ...)` transactional call are permanently out of scope. Their audit row shares a transaction with the mutation it describes; bounding would split that atomicity. The full matrix and evidence pointers are in the FN-9178 `decision` task document; `excluded-awaited-run-audit-store-sites.test.ts`, `excluded-awaited-run-audit-layer-sites.test.ts`, and the core routing ratchet pin this boundary.

### Review convergence events

`task:review-finding-disputed`, `task:review-convergence-escalation`, `task:review-arbitration`, and `task:review-convergence-human-escalation` record review-cycle progression. `task:review-convergence-escalation` includes the fixed `escalationSource` outcome (`dedicated`, `execution-fallback`, or `none`); its `hasModelTarget` flag is true only when a distinct model pair was resolved and persisted. Metadata contains only ids, counts, and fixed outcomes; provider/model identifiers, dispute rationales, findings, reviewer feedback, and arbiter output are never recorded. All five emission sites use the FN-9175 bounded best-effort seam, so hostile telemetry cannot alter or block the ladder, arbitration release, or dispute result.

`task:review-empty-content-parked` records the one-time terminal close for a provably empty Code Review input. Its metadata is limited to task and workflow-step ids, the resting column, and the fixed failed outcome; reviewer prose and findings remain off audit rows. The empty-merge finalize-blocked events also include the fixed `parkedStatus: "failed"` outcome. These writes use bounded best-effort emission and are intentionally outside the curated delivery-pipeline event table.

`task:review-input-recaptured` records a positive review lane that proved its own checkout fast-forwarded and re-bound its identity to the final reviewed content. `task:merge-stale-content-review-rerouted` records a singular stale-content merge refusal, from merge admission or self-healing, that attempted graph-owned review re-entry. Self-healing may recover the bounded-retry rejection, raw merge-door blocker, or retry-exhausted park only after re-seeding the stale lane; metadata uses task and workflow-step ids, fixed reroute reason/source, and fixed park outcome fields (`parkShape`, `parkCleared`, `mergeRetriesReset`) only. Neither event records fingerprints, diffs, paths, findings, or reviewer prose. Both use the FN-9175 bounded best-effort seam.

| Event | Metadata |
| --- | --- |
| `review-remediation-appended` | Task id, gate id, wave, and count only. |
| `review-remediation-parked` | Task id and fixed park outcome only. |

### External block lifecycle

`task:external-block-parked` records a task entering a durable external freeze, and `task:external-block-cleared` records operator Retry publishing its exact resume continuation. Metadata is IDs and fixed classifications only: task id, origin, code, source, column, and resume node id. Raw error prose remains on `Task.externalBlock` and is never copied into run-audit metadata. Both writes use the bounded best-effort emitter and are intentionally outside the curated delivery-pipeline event catalogue.

`task:step-session-abort-contained` records an interrupted step-session repair that retains the current lifecycle lane, checkout, node, and completed step progress. Its metadata is IDs, counts, and fixed outcomes only: task id, current column, abort trigger, recovery outcome, and completed-step count; it never includes failure text or step names. The executor emits it through the bounded best-effort seam, and it is intentionally outside the curated delivery-pipeline event catalogue.

`task:merge-unrun-pre-merge-gate-rerouted` records a merge-admission or self-healing attempt to seed the earliest enabled pre-merge gate that has no result. It uses the FN-9175 bounded best-effort emitter and records only `taskId`, `nodeId`, `workflowStepId`, fixed `reason`, `source`, and `missingGateCount`; it excludes reviewer prose, findings, fingerprints, blocker text, and errors.

### Absent-branch landed reconciliation

`task:reconcile-absent-branch-landed` records an ownership-trailer-proven review card finalized after its branch was cleaned up or when a still-present branch has no remaining task-owned unlanded commits. `task:reconcile-absent-branch-unproven` records a skipped absent-branch candidate. Metadata is IDs and fixed outcomes only: task id, source (`self-healing` or `manual`), branch/base branch identifiers, merge SHA/strategy or fixed reason, and ownership-proof classification; it never contains commit subjects, diffs, or reviewer text. Both emissions use the FN-9175 bounded best-effort engine seam, so hostile sinks cannot alter reconciliation. The unproven event is deduplicated per manager only after its audit write records successfully, allowing a failed audit write to be retried. `fn task reconcile <id>` and the automatic self-healing absent-branch sweep both call the same `SelfHealingManager.reconcileLandedReviewTask` fence, so a manual reconcile and an automatic one can never disagree about what "landed" means.

### Self-improvement ledger events (FUSI-012, wired in FUSI-015; gate verdicts added in FUSI-020)

Four `selfimprove:*` events record the ledger's lifecycle transitions — proposal created, proposal applied, proposal reverted, and gate verdict recorded — through the core bounded run-audit seam (`packages/core/src/self-improve/self-improve-run-audit.ts`). They are the observability edge for the learning-proposal ledger added in FUSI-009/010/011 and its deterministic gate record added in FUSI-020.

**Emission points** — the `TaskStore` WRITE delegations in `packages/core/src/store.ts`: `appendLearningProposal` emits `selfimprove:proposal-created`, `recordLearningApplication` emits `selfimprove:proposal-applied`, `recordLearningReversal` emits `selfimprove:proposal-reverted`, and `recordLearningGateVerdict` emits `selfimprove:gate-verdict-recorded`. Each emit runs after the awaited write has returned its committed row and is deliberately **unawaited**, so telemetry never sits on the transition's success path. `listLearningProposals` and the three gate-verdict READERS (`readLearningGateVerdictByExperiment`, `readLearningGateVerdictByBaseline`, `listLearningGateVerdicts`) emit nothing: a read is not a transition. The audit row's `timestamp` is the transition's own durable instant (the proposal's `createdAt`, the event's `occurredAt`, or the verdict's `occurredAt`), not the emission wall-clock, so the audit trail orders against the ledger it observes; `runId` defaults to the stable `selfimprove-<proposalId>` lineage (or `selfimprove-gate-<experimentId>` for a verdict) rather than a clock-derived id, and `agentId` defaults to the fixed `selfimprove` principal.

**Gate-verdict event** — `selfimprove:gate-verdict-recorded` (FUSI-020) records the deterministic gate's RESOLVED verdict for one experiment against one baseline. It is a FOURTH event rather than a reuse of `selfimprove:proposal-*` because a verdict is identified by an experiment/baseline pair, not a proposal, and is routinely recorded for a candidate that has no proposal row yet; forcing a proposal identity into the metadata would fabricate it. Its input type is therefore its own shape and it does not route through `selfImproveEvent`, while still using the same bounded core seam, fixed principal, and `database` domain. Metadata is an explicit closed list of ids and fixed outcomes: `experimentId`, `baselineId`, all three verdicts (`resolvedVerdict`, `primaryVerdict`, `canaryVerdict` — the divergence is the point, so it must be observable), `precedenceOutcome`, `inputFingerprint`, `corpusVersion`, `seed`, `outcome` (`recorded` | `already-recorded`), and an optional `projectId`. The primary signal booleans and the test-count delta are deliberately NOT duplicated here: they live on the durable verdict row, and a second copy in telemetry would give the two records something else to disagree about. It NEVER contains a diff, the canary's reasoning, or free prose. Both verdicts are read back from the **committed** row rather than the caller's raw input, so the audit row can never contradict the durable verdict it mirrors; an idempotent `already-recorded` re-attempt still emits, with the fixed outcome, so a repeat is visible as a repeat.

**Never-fabricate guard** — the `applied` row's `version`/`confidence`/`value` are not on the appended event, so the delegation reads the committed proposal row through `readLearningProposal`. A missing row, or a read that fails after the event committed, SKIPS the emit and still returns the committed event: a missing audit row is honest, an invented weight is a lie an operator could read off the trail.

**Metadata rule** — ids/counts/fixed outcomes only. No proposal prose, evidence text, rationale, or diff content ever appears in metadata. Each façade builds metadata from an explicit closed field list and never spreads caller input, so adding an optional ledger field cannot silently widen the audit surface. Evidence is recorded as a count (`evidenceCount`) and the pre-application value as a boolean (`hasPriorValue`); `revertReason` is a fixed five-member enum mirrored from the `0088` CHECK.

**Sink independence** — all three façades delegate to `emitBoundedRunAudit` and are fully absorbent: absent, throwing, rejecting, never-settling, and late-settling sinks change nothing about the ledger transition. The sink is best-effort observability, not a lifecycle dependency. This is proven behaviorally, not merely by construction: `packages/core/src/__tests__/self-improve-run-audit-sink-health.test.ts` drives every façade through all six sink modes with fake timers, and the pg suite re-runs a full proposed→applied→reverted lifecycle against a throwing, a rejecting, and a never-settling `recordRunAuditEvent` and asserts every transition still commits.

**Union registry** — the three literals are members of the engine `DatabaseMutationType` union, with a `date -u` FNXC comment stating the metadata rule.

These events are intentionally outside the curated delivery-pipeline event catalogue (`DELIVERY_PIPELINE_RUN_AUDIT_EVENTS`). Adding or removing them requires updating this doc and the `DatabaseMutationType` union together — the run-audit catalogue parity test does not cover them.

### Self-improvement primary-gate run (FUSI-016)

`selfimprove:gate-run` records that a self-improvement candidate was **judged** by the deterministic primary gate, through the core bounded run-audit seam (`packages/core/src/self-improve/self-improve-gate-run-audit.ts`). Where the three ledger events above record that a learning transition *happened*, this one records that a candidate was *evaluated* and what the boolean answer was.

**Emission point** — the gate's caller emits one row per gate run, immediately after the deterministic verdict is assembled. The façade is the **sole writer** of `selfimprove:gate-run`, mirroring the single-writer rule the three ledger façades follow (the rule holds per event: a verdict produced by one code path and an audit row produced by another is the divergence the contract exists to prevent). `runId` defaults to a stable `selfimprove-gate-<candidateSha>` lineage, `agentId` to the fixed `selfimprove` principal, and the row belongs to no task column.

**Metadata rule** — ids/counts/booleans only. The fields are the candidate sha, the boolean `passed` verdict, the content-addressed `fingerprint`, each step as an `[id, boolean]` pair, `failedStepCount`, `affectedTestCount`, the `affectedScopeKind`, and the run `durationMs`. The code diff, each step's command line, and any compiler or test log output are **structurally excluded** — the gate result is a yes/no, and the evidence behind it lives in the ledger and the experiment worktree, not the queryable audit edge. The per-step record is deliberately the step's *boolean*, not the richer outcome vocabulary (`timed-out` vs `failed`): two runs reaching the same boolean decision share a fingerprint, and run-audit mirrors that decision-level identity. The façade builds metadata from an explicit closed field list and never spreads caller input, so a growing verdict can never silently widen the audit surface.

**Sink independence** — the façade delegates to `emitBoundedRunAudit` and is fully absorbent: absent, throwing, rejecting, never-settling, and late-settling sinks leave the caller's verdict completely unchanged. Telemetry never becomes a lifecycle dependency on the decision to keep or revert a candidate. Proven behaviorally in `packages/core/src/__tests__/self-improve-gate-run-audit-sink-health.test.ts`, which drives all six sink modes and asserts the pre-emission verdict stays deep-equal, and that planted diff/command/log keys and values never reach the captured event.

Like the three ledger events, `selfimprove:gate-run` is a member of the engine `DatabaseMutationType` union and is intentionally outside the curated delivery-pipeline event catalogue.

### Self-improvement cost-budget verdicts (FUSI-018)

`selfimprove:cost-budget-evaluated` records that the deterministic primary gate asked its cost question — did the candidate spend more than the configured slack over the same corpus, seed, and order? — and what it answered. It is a **gate verdict, not a ledger transition**: it mutates no proposal state, has no `kind` in the `learning_ledger_events_kind_check` CHECK, and is never appended to that trail. It lives in run-audit only, through the same bounded core seam as the three ledger façades (`emitSelfImproveCostBudgetEvaluated` in `packages/core/src/self-improve/self-improve-run-audit.ts`).

**Outcome** — the deterministic verdict, widened by exactly one value: `within-budget` or `over-budget` from the guard, plus `not-comparable` for a refusal. The refusal is recorded as its own outcome rather than folded into the two budget verdicts because "these runs cannot be compared" is a harness fact the operator must act on, while the other two are the budget question itself.

**Emission point** — the deterministic primary gate, calling the façade once per candidate evaluation. It is deliberately best-effort and never re-judges the verdict: the row records what the gate decided, and nothing about that decision depends on whether the row landed.

**Metadata rule** — identities, counts, and fixed outcomes only. Recorded keys are exactly `proposalId`, `target`, `outcome`, `projectId`, `baselineCorpusId`, `baselineSeed`, `baselineTaskCount`, `baselineFingerprint`, `candidateCorpusId`, `candidateSeed`, `candidateTaskCount`, `candidateFingerprint`, plus the conditional `reason` (on `not-comparable`) and `exceededAxes` (on `over-budget`).

**The measured cost numbers are deliberately NOT audited.** The baseline and candidate token/step/millisecond totals are corpus-specific figures that mean nothing outside the run that produced them — recording `baseline.tokens` beside a candidate's would invite an operator to compare a cached baseline against a candidate possibly measured days later under a different corpus. What is durable is *which* corpus, *which* seed, *how many* tasks, and *which* axes moved; the arithmetic is re-derivable from the recorded identities, and the `sha256:` fingerprints let a later reader prove they hold the same pair of runs. `exceededAxes` is filtered through the fixed `tokens|steps|wallClockMs` membership, so an unrecognized axis can never be written into telemetry.

**Sink independence** — the façade delegates to `emitBoundedRunAudit` and is fully absorbent: absent, throwing, rejecting, never-settling, and late-settling sinks leave the caller's verdict unchanged. Proven behaviorally in `packages/core/src/__tests__/self-improve-cost-budget.test.ts`, which drives the façade through all six sink modes with fake timers.

**Union registry** — the literal is a member of the engine `DatabaseMutationType` union, with a `date -u` FNXC comment stating the metadata rule. Like the other `selfimprove:*` events it is outside `DELIVERY_PIPELINE_RUN_AUDIT_EVENTS`, so the delivery-pipeline catalogue parity test does not cover it; this doc and the union must be updated together.

### Merge-boundary evidence recovery (FN-9345)

Missing implementation proof is normally repaired through the workflow's durable task log and graph remediation path before merge admission. On startup and periodic maintenance, `task:merge-boundary-evidence-recovered` records a historic proofless park only after durable unfinished work, lifecycle ownership, liveness, and auto-merge policy are re-verified. These repairs intentionally do not put boundary reason prose, foreach identities, paths, review output, or external capability diagnostics in run-audit metadata. If recovery cannot prove an executable owner, the existing terminal `task:merge-boundary-unproven-parked` event remains the fail-closed audit surface and retains its ids/counts/fixed-outcomes-only contract.

## Self-improvement learning ledger

The self-improvement loop's proposal/evidence ledger follows the same ids/counts/outcomes-only rule for its transition events and emits them through the bounded core seam. See the [Self-Improvement Learning Ledger contract](./self-improvement-ledger.md#run-audit) for the fields, state machine, and reversal contract those events describe.

## Self-improvement learning revert

`learning:reverted` records one **revert attempt** against the self-improvement learning ledger, emitted through the core bounded seam (`packages/core/src/run-audit/emit-bounded-run-audit.ts`) because `@fusion/core` cannot import the engine seam. A revert is the loop's authoritative undo, so this row is what answers "was this experiment backed out, and how many times" after the fact.

**One row is emitted per attempt, including the no-op outcomes.** The outcome is a fixed enum: `reverted` (a reversal event was appended), `already-reverted` (this exact application was cancelled before — the retry was absorbed and wrote nothing), and `not-applied` (there was no un-reverted application to cancel, so nothing was written). Recording the no-ops is what makes a retry visible rather than silent; only `reverted` mutates the ledger.

**Metadata is ids/counts/fixed-outcomes only** and never carries a verdict, free prose, a diff, or the restored value itself:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `proposalId` | The learning proposal the reversal belongs to. |
| `target` | The product surface the proposal acts on (`memory`, `evals`, or `skills`); absent when the proposal was not found. |
| `appliedEventId` | The `applied` event the revert cancelled or would cancel; `null` when none was located. |
| `revertEventId` | The derived id of the appended reversal; `null` for a no-op. |
| `outcome` | Fixed enum `reverted` \| `already-reverted` \| `not-applied`. |
| `reason` | Fixed enum `gate-rejected` \| `operator-veto` \| `superseded` \| `expired` \| `manual`. |

**Readers counting ledger events must filter out `store:open`.** Every `TaskStore.init()` emits a `store:open` row, so a query that counts or orders the whole table sees a phantom row that has nothing to do with the learning trail. Filter to `mutation_type LIKE 'learning:%'` (or the specific type) before counting or asserting an ordered sequence. The same rule is why a caller cannot treat "one init, one learning row" as an exact-count invariant.

**Idempotency is visible through the pair of rows, not through a status flag.** Because the reversal is an append naming the application it cancels, a repeated revert produces a second `learning:reverted` row with `outcome: already-reverted` and no new ledger event. The ledger row and its telemetry always agree: the audit `outcome` mirrors the ledger state exactly.
