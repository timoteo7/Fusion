Thanks for contributing to Fusion.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (current LTS recommended)
- pnpm (`packageManager` is pnpm)
- Git
- `pi` runtime/auth configured for AI features

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### pnpm build-scripts approval policy

pnpm v10 blocks dependency `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` scripts by default and reports any uncategorized packages in the install output.

When a package is flagged:

- Approve it only when this repo genuinely needs that dependency's build script for supported runtime/build paths.
- Ignore it when prebuilt artifacts, optional-native fallbacks, or release-only tooling make the script unnecessary for normal workspace verification.
- Record every reviewed package in exactly one bucket: `onlyBuiltDependencies` or `ignoredBuiltDependencies`.

Fusion currently keeps the reviewed decision set documented in the root `package.json` `pnpm` block and mirrored in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is the effective pnpm v10.33 install-time config read by `pnpm install`.

The guard test `node --test scripts/__tests__/pnpm-build-scripts-config.test.mjs` (also covered by `pnpm test:scripts`) enforces that the reviewed dependencies stay categorized, deduped, and non-overlapping so the ignored-build-scripts warning cannot silently return.

### Build workspace packages

```bash
pnpm build      # default build (excludes desktop/mobile)
pnpm build:all  # full recursive build including desktop/mobile
```

### Git LFS (demo reel GIFs)

The demo reel GIFs in `demo/assets/*.gif` are stored via [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) so the binaries live outside the packfile and re-shot captures stop bloating `.git` (see `.gitattributes`).

Install Git LFS **before** cloning or pulling, otherwise these files arrive as small text pointer stubs instead of real GIFs:

```bash
# macOS: brew install git-lfs   (or your platform's package manager)
git lfs install        # one-time, per machine
```

If you already cloned without LFS, run `git lfs install` then `git lfs pull` to hydrate the GIFs. New GIFs added under `demo/assets/` are routed to LFS automatically by the `.gitattributes` filter — no extra steps.

## Workspace Package Overview

pnpm local --no-engine # fast local dashboard/API-only startup
pnpm local --prebuild <none|client|full>  # local dashboard/API + AI engine startup with an explicit prebuild level
pnpm dev               # source-mode CLI; dashboard gets a client-only prebuild, other commands skip it
pnpm dev:watch         # dashboard + engine; gracefully restart runtime source after active agents drain
FUSION_DEV_PREBUILD=full pnpm dev dashboard  # production-like full workspace prebuild
pnpm dev:ui            # dashboard dev server only
pnpm dev:hmr           # dashboard API + Vite UI HMR + graceful runtime source restarts
pnpm dev --tunnel      # dev server + a public Cloudflare quick-tunnel URL (see below)
pnpm dev --tunnel=5173 # tunnel a specific port (e.g. a Vite server) instead of the dashboard
pnpm lint              # lint all packages
pnpm test              # merge-gate suite + changed-only affected tests (bounded; never full-suite)
pnpm test:gate         # the merge gate: curated engine-core suite + CI-shape test
pnpm smoke:boot        # boot smoke: CLI --help + real serve /api/health
pnpm test:full         # full workspace suite (explicit opt-in; clean-worktree compatible)
pnpm build             # workspace builds (excludes desktop/mobile)
pnpm build:all         # full workspace build (includes desktop/mobile)
pnpm verify:workspace  # deep opt-in verification: lint -> test:full -> build
pnpm typecheck         # workspace typechecks
```

## Sharing a dev server (`pnpm dev --tunnel`)

When Fusion runs somewhere other than your laptop — a container, a shared box, a remote host — a dev
server bound inside it is unreachable from your own browser. `--tunnel` publishes it through a
**Cloudflare quick tunnel** and prints the URL:

```bash
pnpm dev --tunnel              # tunnels the dashboard port (PORT, default 4040)
pnpm dev --tunnel=5173         # tunnels a specific port, e.g. a Vite dev server
pnpm dev --tunnel dashboard    # tunnel the default port AND run the dashboard
FUSION_DEV_TUNNEL=1 pnpm dev   # same, from the environment
```

Tunnelling the dashboard (the default) prints the bearer token and a link that already carries it,
because a tunnel URL you cannot open is not a shared dev server:

```
  ┌ dev server tunnel
  │ https://mic-relatively-jewelry-belly.trycloudflare.com  →  http://localhost:4040
  │ token: fn_1a2b3c…
  │ ready-to-open: https://mic-relatively-jewelry-belly.trycloudflare.com/?token=fn_1a2b3c…
  └ that link carries the token — share it only with whoever should have access
```

Tunnelling any other port has no Fusion auth to lend it, and says so:

```
  ┌ dev server tunnel
  │ https://mic-relatively-jewelry-belly.trycloudflare.com  →  http://localhost:5173
  └ anyone with this URL can reach that port — Fusion adds no auth to it
```

### Running against an isolated database (`--isolated`)

Working on Fusion from inside a machine that already runs one — a container, a shared box — a plain
`pnpm dev` **shares that instance's live database**. Everything durable hangs off `$HOME/.fusion`
(settings, credentials, central DB, the embedded Postgres data dir), and a second process pointed at
a data dir whose postmaster is already running attaches to it rather than starting its own.

```bash
pnpm dev --isolated --tunnel        # own database, own project dir, own tunnel
pnpm dev --isolated=/tmp/sandbox    # put the sandbox somewhere specific
FUSION_DEV_ISOLATED=1 pnpm dev      # same, from the environment
```

`--isolated` gives the dev server its own `HOME` (so its own `.fusion`, credentials and Postgres
cluster, on its own port) **and** its own project directory. Both matter: `fn dashboard` derives its
project from the working directory, so isolating `HOME` alone would leave both instances sharing
`<repo>/.fusion` — including `.fusion/tasks/<id>/`, which self-healing's orphaned-task-dir sweep
re-imports, so a fresh dev database would adopt the real instance's tasks.

The sandbox defaults to `~/.fusion-dev/<checkout-name>/` — outside the work tree, so it neither shows
up in `git status` nor dies on a clean checkout, and keyed by checkout so two clones do not collide.
Its project directory is `git init`-ed on first use, because Fusion projects are git work trees. The
dev database persists across restarts; delete the directory to start fresh.

Requires `cloudflared` on PATH (the Docker image ships it). Quick tunnels need no account, domain, or
payment card **because a dev server is HTTP** — the TCP endpoints that something like SSH would need
require a card (ngrok) or a domain plus Zero Trust (Cloudflare), which is why this flag exists only
for HTTP.

Behaviour worth knowing:

- **What guards the URL depends on the target.** A tunnel to the DASHBOARD port is still behind the
  dashboard's bearer token (the banner prints it and a token-bearing link — treat that link as the
  credential it is). A tunnel to any OTHER port is genuinely open: anyone holding the URL reaches it,
  so use it for sharing a preview, not for anything sensitive. `--no-auth` opens the dashboard too,
  and the banner says so.
- **The token comes from the same place the dashboard's does** — `FUSION_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`,
  `FUSION_DAEMON_TOKEN`, then `~/.fusion/settings.json`. On a first authenticated run the token may
  not exist yet when the tunnel comes up; the banner then points at the dashboard's own startup line.
- **The tunnel waits for the dev server, and never guesses.** It publishes only the port the dev
  server reports it actually bound. If startup is slow — or stopped on an interactive prompt such as
  `Run central db now? (Y/n)` — no tunnel appears and the wrapper says so once a minute. It will not
  fall back to the configured port: on a machine where something else already owns that port (a
  container whose own Fusion holds 4040) that published a "dev server" URL serving a different
  instance entirely.
- **A failed tunnel never takes the dev server down.** If `cloudflared` is missing or no URL is
  published, it logs and carries on; losing a preview URL must not cost you your dev loop.
- **Restarts reuse the tunnel.** In `--watch` mode a fresh quick tunnel would hand out a different
  hostname on every reload, invalidating the link you already shared.
- **`--tunnel` only consumes a following token when it is numeric**, so `pnpm dev --tunnel dashboard`
  still forwards `dashboard` to the dev command.

### Fusion inside Fusion: two instances, each with its own engine

Developing Fusion from inside a container that is already running Fusion needs all three flags
together. The container's own dashboard owns 4040 and its database, so a plain `pnpm dev --tunnel`
collides with it in two ways that are easy to misread as unrelated breakage:

```bash
cd /home/node/fusion && pnpm dev dashboard --port 4050 --tunnel=4050 --isolated
```

- **`--isolated`** — own database, own project directory, and its own engine (it redirects `HOME` and
  the working directory; the engine still starts normally, so both instances run a real one). Without
  it the dev server shares the live database, and Command Center's **Restart engine**
  (`POST /system/engine/restart`) enumerates every project in that shared database, pause/resumes each,
  and on a failed resume leaves a **compensating pause** behind. That pause is durable: the container's
  own project is left `status: "paused"`, its dashboard logs `Failed to start engine for project …:
  Project … is paused`, and remote-access calls fail with `REMOTE_TUNNEL_ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE`. Nothing
  self-heals it and recreating the container does not clear it — the fix is
  `POST /projects/:id/resume`.
- **`--port 4050`** — any free port other than the one the outer instance holds. Otherwise the
  dashboard hits `EADDRINUSE` and falls back to `listen(0)`, binding a **different random port on
  every restart**. The tunnel is opened once against whatever port that first start landed on, so the
  next restart silently strands the URL you were using.
- **`--tunnel=4050`** — names the target explicitly. `PORT=4050` alone is **not** enough: it only
  feeds the tunnel's guess, while the dashboard resolves its own bind port separately, so the server
  still lands on an ephemeral port.

Verify the two are genuinely separate by comparing project lists — they must not match:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:4050/api/projects   # dev sandbox
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:4040/api/projects   # the real instance
```

Two gotchas when restarting the dev instance:

- **Killing it needs to match the tsx child.** Its command line is
  `node --conditions=source --require …/tsx…` and contains neither `pnpm dev` nor `dev-with-memory`,
  so a pattern matching only those leaves it alive holding the port — and the replacement instance
  then quietly rebinds elsewhere while appearing to run. Confirm the port is free
  (`curl` returns `000`) before starting a new one.
- **`kill -9` strands the embedded Postgres.** A hard kill leaves `postmaster.pid` behind, and the
  next start tries to JOIN that dead cluster instead of starting one, exiting 1 with
  `joined instance was not yet accepting connections`. Delete
  `~/.fusion-dev/<checkout-name>/home/.fusion/embedded-postgres/default/postmaster.pid` and start again.

## Deterministic workspace verification bootstrap

Fusion codifies workspace verification as a deterministic contract:

- Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for clean bootstrap and dependency repair paths.
- `pnpm test:full` must be runnable in a clean worktree without requiring a prior `pnpm build`.
- Root test entrypoints (`pnpm test` via `scripts/test-changed.mjs` and `pnpm test:ci:shard` via `scripts/ci-test-shard.mjs`) call `scripts/ensure-test-artifacts.mjs`, which deterministically builds only missing/stale required workspace dist artifacts (`@fusion/core`, `@fusion/dashboard`, `@fusion/engine`, `@fusion/plugin-sdk`, and `@fusion-plugin-examples/{dependency-graph,hermes-runtime,openclaw-runtime,paperclip-runtime}`).
- Package-scoped hooks now mirror this bootstrap for fresh worktrees where needed: `@fusion/dashboard` and `@fusion-plugin-examples/dependency-graph` run `pretest: node ../../scripts/ensure-test-artifacts.mjs`.
- This includes clean states where those required dist directories are absent.
- `pnpm test:gate` is the merge gate: the curated `engine-core` suite plus the CI-shape test. CI blocks PRs on exactly Lint, Typecheck, Build, and Gate (boot smoke + `pnpm test:gate`) — see `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` and docs/testing.md.
- `pnpm verify:workspace` is the deep opt-in verification (not the merge gate) and runs in strict order:
  1. `pnpm lint`
  2. `pnpm test:full`
  3. `pnpm build`

GitHub Actions runs deterministic test sharding via `pnpm test:ci:shard --shard <index> --total <count>` in the non-blocking `full-suite.yml` workflow (push to main only — never a PR gate), while keeping local semantics unchanged:

- `pnpm test` remains gate + changed-only local iteration.
- `pnpm test:full` remains the explicit full workspace suite; dashboard exhaustive coverage is explicit via `pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test:deep`.
- `pnpm verify:workspace` remains the deep opt-in lint -> test -> build verification.

`test:ci:shard` is a CI-focused entrypoint (`scripts/ci-test-shard.mjs`) that deterministically balances workspace packages with `test` scripts by counting package-local `**/__tests__/**/*.test.{ts,tsx,mjs}` files, auto-splitting oversized packages into virtual shard entries (`{ name, shardIndex, shardCount }`), then assigning entries in descending weight order with best-fit placement for unsplit entries (closest under-budget fit, otherwise minimum overshoot) while keeping slices of the same package on different shards when possible. Whole entries run as grouped `pnpm --filter <pkg> test` calls, and virtual entries run one-by-one via `pnpm --filter <pkg> test --shard <index>/<count>` (no bare `--`, because Vitest's cac parser would otherwise treat the shard flag as a filter separator). This keeps coverage reproducible while improving shard balance.

`pnpm test` now uses a changed-only entrypoint (`scripts/test-changed.mjs`) for faster local iteration. It resolves the comparison base from `.changeset/config.json` (`baseBranch`) and runs only affected workspaces from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (both `packages/*` and `plugins/**`) using safe package-first filtering (`pnpm --filter <pkg> test`). It runs the merge-gate suite first, then the affected set. The full suite runs only on explicit opt-in (`--full` / `pnpm test:full`); shared-infrastructure changes and unresolvable diffs widen the affected set but never escalate to an implicit full-suite run (the old escalation was the local OOM path).

Root test entrypoints (`pnpm test`, `pnpm test:full`, and `pnpm test:ci:shard`) now use a shared CPU-aware default worker budget instead of fixed low values. By default, Fusion sets `FUSION_TEST_TOTAL_WORKERS` to `max(4, min(12, cpuCount - 1))` and `FUSION_TEST_CONCURRENCY` to `2` (clamped to the total budget), while still honoring explicit overrides from `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS`, `FUSION_TEST_TOTAL_WORKERS`, and `FUSION_TEST_CONCURRENCY`.

### Test isolation contract (required)

Fusion tests must run against disposable test data, never live local state:

- The canonical Vitest bootstrap is `packages/core/src/__test-utils__/vitest-setup.ts`.
- Workspace/package Vitest configs should use package-local `src/__tests__/setup-test-isolation.ts` shims that call into the shared core bootstrap rather than re-implementing HOME/cwd isolation.
- Test runs must use temp HOME and temp workspace/project roots so global settings resolve under temporary directories instead of real `~/.fusion`.
- The repository `.fusion` directory is treated as protected live data; root test entrypoints run `scripts/check-test-isolation.mjs` to fail if tests mutate protected Fusion data paths.
- `pnpm test` (`scripts/test-changed.mjs`) now creates a disposable temp HOME/USERPROFILE for the entire run (including cache-hit no-op guard checks), so concurrent writes from an active local Fusion session to your real `~/.fusion` do not trigger false positives.

If you add or change test entrypoints, keep this isolation guard path intact and ensure guard + test execution share the same disposable HOME so changed/full/cached paths stay consistent.

## Spec authoring: provenance evidence for outside tooling

Any task that wires in an outside command-line program, daemon, separately-fetched program, or package-managed dependency must include provenance evidence in its `PROMPT.md`. The deterministic spec-validation gate (`detectExternalIntegrationEvidenceGaps`) REVISEs specs that mention this kind of outside tooling without enough provenance to audit where it comes from and what command or artifact is expected.

Use a dedicated `## External Integration Evidence` or `## External-Integration Evidence` section when possible. The gate accepts semantically labeled bullets; labels may include or omit a trailing `URL`/`name`, may use `/` or `:` separators (for example `Docs / homepage URL:` or `Docs/homepage:`), and URLs may be bare or backtick-wrapped.

Include all five evidence fields:

1. Canonical upstream repo URL — a GitHub URL with distinct owner/repo; duplicate owner/owner placeholders are rejected.
2. Docs / homepage URL — a distinct non-GitHub, non-artifact URL.
3. Release / download URL — a GitHub `…/releases/…` URL, a generic `…download…` URL, an npm `registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>/-/<name>-<ver>.tgz` URL, or any `.tgz`/`.tar.gz` artifact URL.
4. Binary / CLI name — the command name in backticks, such as `` `wt` ``.
5. Checksum — a `sha256`/`sha512` digest, a pinned-manifest token, or the literal `upstream-pending-verification` marker. The marker is accepted for the checksum field only; never use it in place of source, docs, or artifact URLs.

Never fabricate source URLs, command names, release locations, or checksums. Cite real provenance, or use `upstream-pending-verification` only for the checksum field while the digest is being pinned.

<!-- evidence-example:start -->
```markdown
## External Integration Evidence

- Canonical upstream repo URL: https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk
- Docs / homepage URL: https://worktrunk.dev/
- Release / download URL: https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/releases/latest/download/wt-linux-x64.tar.gz
- Binary / CLI name: `wt`
- Checksum: `sha256-<digest>` (or `upstream-pending-verification` until the checksum is pinned)
```
<!-- evidence-example:end -->

### Product summary in task specifications

Every generated or hand-authored `PROMPT.md` must place `## What This Delivers` immediately after `## Original Description` and before `## Before → After Transformation`. Write this short section in plain product language: state what the operator will be able to do, see, or stop suffering once the task ships. Do not include file paths or symbol names; those technical details belong in `## Mission`. This is the operator's at-a-glance intent check, and Plan Review treats a missing or jargon-only summary as a blocking REVISE.

## Quality Gate Checklist

Before submitting changes, verify:

- [ ] `pnpm test:gate` — the merge gate (curated engine-core suite + CI-shape test)
- [ ] `pnpm verify:workspace` — deep opt-in lint → test:full → build verification
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` — type checking passes

## Realtime/SSE change note

If your change touches dashboard realtime behavior (`/api/events`, SSE hooks, proxy event streams, or dedicated stream endpoints), review and update the canonical contract doc:

- [`docs/dashboard-realtime.md`](./dashboard-realtime.md)

Do not create parallel SSE architecture docs. Keep ownership/scoping/cleanup guidance centralized there.

## Testing Requirements

Use real test runs (not manual verification substitutes):

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm test:coverage:core
pnpm test:coverage:engine
pnpm test:coverage:cli
pnpm test:coverage:dashboard
```

### Test File Organization

All test files live in `__tests__/` subdirectories alongside the code they test:

- Test for `src/foo.ts` → `src/__tests__/foo.test.ts`
- Test for `app/components/Bar.tsx` → `app/components/__tests__/Bar.test.tsx`

When adding new tests, follow this convention. The monorepo has been standardized on `__tests__/` organization.

## Build Standalone Executables

Fusion supports standalone binary builds through Bun compile scripts in the CLI package.

```bash
pnpm build:exe      # build host-target executable
pnpm build:exe:all  # build multi-target executables
```

Cross-compiling a foreign target fetches the matching `@lydell/node-pty-<platform>-<arch>` payload, verifies its sha512 integrity against `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and caches it in `node_modules/.cache/fusion-node-pty/`. A build fails if the PTY payload cannot be staged; `--allow-missing-native` is the explicit opt-out for intentionally producing a terminal-less binary.

## CLI Integration Test Lanes

Default workspace verification stays lean and deterministic:

- `pnpm test` runs the standard suite and does **not** require Bun cross-build integration tests.
- `pnpm verify:workspace` remains the deep opt-in `lint -> test -> build` verification.

Slow/pre-release CLI coverage is explicit and opt-in:

```bash
pnpm test:slow-cli                                  # workspace entrypoint
pnpm --filter @runfusion/fusion test:slow-cli       # agent-export integration (FUSION_TEST_SLOW_CLI=1)
pnpm --filter @runfusion/fusion test:build-exe      # native binary cross-build integration (FUSION_TEST_BUILD_EXE=1)
pnpm --filter @runfusion/fusion test:pre-release    # combined CLI slow lane (slow-cli + build-exe)
```

Additional audited suite:

```bash
pnpm --filter @runfusion/fusion test:extension-integration
```

`test:extension-integration` enables `FUSION_TEST_EXTENSION_INTEGRATION=1` and runs the full fn pi extension integration suite. It remains an explicit opt-in lane so default workspace verification stays fast, while still providing a discoverable command for full extension-tool integration coverage.

## Dashboard Test Lanes

Dashboard tests are split into explicit local lanes. The default dashboard package gate is a curated quality gate that keeps representative app/API coverage without running every exhaustive modal, view, and route permutation on every local or PR pass:

```bash
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test                # curated app/API quality gate
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test:deep           # exhaustive app + API suite
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test:app            # exhaustive React/jsdom app tests
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test:api            # exhaustive Node API/server tests
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test:browser-smoke  # local browser layout smoke
pnpm --filter @fusion/dashboard test:build          # built client output contract
```

Use the default lane for normal local iteration before PRs. Run `test:deep` when changing broad dashboard architecture, shared modal/view infrastructure, or route registration behavior where the exhaustive permutations are still useful. The built-client contract remains a separate lane because it performs its own production build. `pnpm build` remains an explicit PR gate, and PR test shards avoid a redundant pre-test workspace build to save GitHub Actions minutes.

## Release Process

Fusion uses Changesets + version PR workflow.

- See [RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md) for release flow details.
- For published package behavior changes, include a changeset using the structured body format (`summary`, `category`, optional `dev` fields). See the changeset format guide in [`.changeset/README.md`](../.changeset/README.md).

## Code Signing

Release binary signing setup is documented here:

- [Code Signing Setup](./CODE_SIGNING.md)

## Git / Commit Conventions

Use task-ID-scoped conventional commits:

- `feat(FN-XXX): ...`
- `fix(FN-XXX): ...`
- `test(FN-XXX): ...`
- `docs(FN-XXX): ...` (for documentation-only changes)

## Project Memory

When enabled, Fusion uses OpenClaw-style memory files:

- `.fusion/memory/MEMORY.md` — long-term project memory
- `.fusion/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily running notes
- `.fusion/memory/DREAMS.md` — dream-processing memory file
- The legacy top-level memory file is a deprecated migration fallback (seed/alias behavior) and should not be treated as canonical

Use project memory for reusable patterns, constraints, and pitfalls that should persist across tasks.

### Background Memory Summarization

Fusion can automatically extract insights from memory and prune transient content. Enable via `insightExtractionEnabled` setting:

- `.fusion/memory/MEMORY.md` — Canonical long-term memory source (inside the layered `.fusion/memory/` workspace) compacted/pruned by extraction jobs
- `.fusion/memory/memory-insights.md` — Distilled insights output
- `.fusion/memory/memory-audit.md` — Audit report after each extraction (includes pruning outcome)

See [Settings Reference](./settings-reference.md#background-memory-summarization--audit) for configuration details.

## Localization (i18n)

User-facing strings are localized with react-i18next across both the dashboard
and the terminal UI. English is the source-of-truth; catalogs and shared config
live in the `@fusion/i18n` package. To translate, add a language, or wire new
strings, see the [Localization contributor guide](./i18n-contributing.md). When
adding user-facing copy, prefer `t("namespace:key", "English default")` over a
hardcoded string and run `pnpm i18n:extract` to register the key.

## Dashboard CSS Organization

The dashboard's CSS has been modularized:

- **Global stylesheet** (`packages/dashboard/app/styles.css`, ~4,500 lines)
  - Design tokens, primitives (`.btn`, `.card`, `.modal`, `.form-input`), global cross-component rules
- **Per-component stylesheets** (56+ files in `packages/dashboard/app/components/`)
  - Each component needing CSS has a co-located `ComponentName.css`
  - Each `ComponentName.tsx` must import: `import "./ComponentName.css";`

**Rule:** New component CSS goes in the component's `.css` file, not in `styles.css`. Only truly global rules belong in the root stylesheet.

### Icon-only button sizing contract

Dashboard icon-only controls should use the shared `.btn-icon` contract instead of ad-hoc Lucide `size={12}` / `size={14}` props:

- `.btn-icon` defaults icon glyphs to `--icon-size-md` via `--btn-icon-size`
- compact icon-only buttons (`.btn-icon.btn-sm`, `.btn.btn-icon.btn--sm`) automatically use `--icon-size-sm`
- keep intentionally smaller directional affordances (for example split-button chevrons or non-button inline indicators) as explicit local exceptions in component CSS/JSX

Use component-local overrides only when a surface has a deliberate visual exception; ordinary icon-only actions should inherit the shared contract.

### Todo/list action-row pattern

For dense list rows (for example TodoView items), keep action buttons in a dedicated second row instead of cramming controls beside the primary text line:

- define row-action layout in the component-local stylesheet (for example `TodoView.css`), not `styles.css`
- use spacing/layout tokens (`--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--transition-*`) instead of literal spacing values
- if row actions are hover-revealed on desktop, include a required mobile override under `@media (max-width: 768px)` that forces visibility (`opacity: 1`) so touch devices can always access controls

### CSS Testing

For CSS regression tests, use the helper at `packages/dashboard/app/test/cssFixture.ts`:

```ts
import { loadAllAppCss, loadAllAppCssBaseOnly } from "../test/cssFixture";

// Load all CSS (styles.css + all component .css)
const allCss = await loadAllAppCss();

// Load base rules only (strips @media/@supports)
const baseOnly = await loadAllAppCssBaseOnly();
```

Never directly `readFileSync('../styles.css')` — the ESLint rule `no-restricted-syntax` in `eslint.config.mjs` blocks this in test files and directs you to `cssFixture.ts`.

## SQLite Test Runner Pitfall

When running engine tests with Vitest and `node:sqlite`, ensure the engine Vitest config uses thread pool mode:

- ✅ `pool: "threads"`
- ❌ `pool: "vmThreads"`

`node:sqlite` fails under Vitest VM contexts; using threads avoids that failure mode.
