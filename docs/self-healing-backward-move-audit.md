# Self-Healing Backward-Move Audit (FN-5335)

## Invariant
Backward lifecycle moves (in-progress → todo, in-review → in-progress/todo, in-review → paused-stuck/failed) from a maintenance sweep require **triple proof**:
1. Verified dead session — no active session registry entry for any `pathsForTask(taskId)`, no `executingTaskLock.has(taskId)`, and `this.options.isTaskActive?.(taskId) !== true`.
2. Unusable worktree — `classifyTaskWorktree(this.options.rootDir, task.worktree)` returns `{ ok: false }`, OR `task.worktree` is null and there is no registered `fusion/<id>` worktree.
3. No recent executor activity — stage staleness anchor exceeds stage grace window and there is no recent `worktree:incomplete-detected` event within the same trailing window.

Stages that cannot satisfy all three must either (a) tighten predicate to require triple proof, or (b) downgrade to annotation-only (`task:<stage>-no-action`).

## Per-stage rationale
### FN-8924 — retain age-based interrupted-merge recovery
- **Decision: REJECT.** `recoverInterruptedMergingTasks()` retains `Date.now() - task.updatedAt >= settings.taskStuckTimeoutMs` for its non-owner grace gate.
- **Concrete counter-evidence:** the required replacement clock, `getLastMergerAgentActivityMs(taskId)`, reads entries written by the merger itself. The merge body's `log()` helper in `packages/engine/src/merge/merger-ai.ts` appends a task `logEntry` and a `"merger"` agent log together (lines 1317–1321; duplicated by the workspace helper at 1869–1873). These diagnostic writes are intentionally best-effort/unfenced, so an abandoned or superseded merge body can refresh both `updatedAt` and the proposed attributed clock. Merger-recency is therefore not an orphan-proof, task-scoped clock and cannot satisfy FN-8924's adoption bias.
- The process-global active-merge-start clock is not an alternative: `measureActiveMergeSilenceMs()` falls back to `getActiveMergeStartedAtMs()` only for the owner path, where `isActiveMergeWedged()` first proves task identity. It has no task parameter and can belong to another merge. No durable cross-process merge-ownership claim or lease exists; the remaining pending/task-active/session/lock signals are in-process only, leaving the same cross-process blind spot that the retained age gate already has.
- Consequently, the owner arm and all mutation-time recovery behavior remain unchanged. The proposed two-phase re-proof and routing-input divergence design is not adopted without a sound admission clock; changing sibling stale-status, deadlock, or dashboard Retry definitions would create unsupported divergent semantics. The regression test pins this contract: a fresh-`updatedAt`, unowned merge-active task is not recovered even if an older merger log would satisfy the rejected quiet-window proposal.

### recoverStaleIncompleteReviewTasks
- Current evidence is age + incomplete steps only; this can race live executor/session churn.
- Tighten chosen: preserve recovery semantics but require dead-session + unusable-worktree + stale activity proof.
- Composes with FN-5147 first (autoMerge false short-circuit), then FN-5335 proof gate.

### recoverGhostReviewTasks
- Current evidence is idle age + status exclusion; no hard proof task is dead.
- Tighten chosen to avoid speculative in-review→todo regressions.

### reclaimPrConflictForTask / reclaimSelfOwnedBranchConflicts
- These can push in-review backward to todo on conflict reclaim paths.
- Tighten chosen for backward path only; forward/metadata-only branches unchanged.

### finalizeNoOpReviewTasks (fallback backward edge)
- Method is mostly forward finalize; fallback requeue path can move backward.
- Tighten only that branch.

### recoverStuckMergeDeadlocks (no-landed branch)
- Existing no-landed path pauses immediately after failed landed-proof.
- Tighten chosen: pause/fail mutation requires triple proof; otherwise annotate and leave terminal state untouched.

### recoverNoProgressNoTaskDoneFailures
- Current predicate checks progress/git cleanliness but not session/worktree/liveness triple-proof.
- Tighten to prevent reopening actively recovering tasks and to compose with FN-4935 recent liveness events.

### recoverMissingWorktreeReviewFailures
- Existing classifier proof is necessary but not sufficient for backward movement.
- Tightened: require full triple-proof before auto requeue, and keep `allowsAutoMergeProcessing` as the first lifecycle gate so `autoMerge:false` remains terminal-until-merged.
- Merge-active rows (`merging`, `merging-pr`, `merging-fix`) with the same unusable-worktree session-start signature are now owned here before interrupted/deadlocked merge sweeps can re-drive the phantom path. Workspace tasks are annotation-only in this path; per-repo land recovery remains workspace-owned.

### recoverPartialProgressNoTaskDoneFailures
- Retry-budget alone can still reopen tasks under active/residual execution races.
- Tighten: add triple-proof gate before each requeue.

### surfaceInReviewStalls deadlock branch
- Classified BACKWARD but retained as already-tightened due explicit deadlock threshold + FN-5147 terminal-until-merged guard contract.

## Stages explicitly left alone
- Forward-only: `recoverCompletedTasks`, `recoverStrandedCompletedTodoTasks`, `recoverMergedReviewTasks`, `recoverAlreadyMergedReviewTasks`, `recoverBranchMisboundInReviewTasks`, `recoverOrphanOnlyScopeViolations`.
- Already-tightened proof owners: `recoverInProgressLimbo` (FN-5219), `recoverCompletionHandoffLimbo` (FN-4999), `recoverOrphanedExecutions` (FN-5337 `task:orphan-detected-no-action`).
- RECONCILE/annotation-only stages remain unchanged.

## Step 1 self-check coverage
Executed mutation-scan `grep -nE 'moveTask\(.*"todo"|moveTask\(.*"in-progress"|updateTask\(.*paused:\s*true|status:\s*"failed"' packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts` and confirmed every mutation site is represented above with explicit direction + disposition (including `autoReboundPausedScopeDecayDetailed`, `surfaceInReviewStalls` deadlock branch, and `recoverStuckMergeDeadlocks` no-landed pause branch).

## Open questions / out-of-scope
- None discovered in Step 1 requiring separate task creation.
