# Mobile keyboard restore stale viewport reset

## Problem

`useMobileKeyboard` protects normal in-session keyboard handling from impossible iOS samples: when an input is focused, a transient sample that reports a restored full viewport but still carries stale open-keyboard metrics can be held so the dashboard does not flicker. That FN-5155 guard is useful while the page is active, but it also masked a real restore transition.

When the app returned from `hidden`/`pageshow` with the soft keyboard collapsed and the focused input still active, the hook reused the previous open-keyboard metrics. Because focus remained on the input, the impossible-sample hold treated the collapsed restore sample as suspicious and kept `keyboardOpen`, `viewportHeight`, and `offsetTop` stale until another resize or blur arrived.

## Solution

Handle page restore as a distinct sampling path rather than weakening the normal in-session guard.

- On `visibilitychange` back to `visible` and on `pageshow`, take an immediate restore sample.
- If the restore sample is a collapsed/full-height viewport, reset the baseline viewport height and bypass the impossible-sample hold for that one sample.
- Keep FN-5155's impossible-sample hold in place for regular resize/focus/tail updates.
- Continue scheduling delayed tail updates after restore so later iOS viewport corrections still land.

This lets a collapsed restore clear `keyboardOpen`, `viewportHeight`, and `offsetTop` even when `document.activeElement` is still an input, while a genuinely open restored keyboard remains open.

## Regression coverage

Cover restore as a surface invariant, not only the single iOS reproduction:

- `visibilitychange` from hidden to visible with retained focus and a collapsed viewport resets stale open-keyboard metrics.
- `pageshow` with stale positive `visualViewport.offsetTop` drift clears the keyboard state when the viewport is full height.
- A genuinely shrunken restored viewport remains keyboard-open.
- Android-style shrink metrics reset without carrying iOS offset drift.
- Existing FN-5155 in-session impossible-sample coverage remains green, proving the normal guard was not removed.

The hook-level test seam is preferable here because callers already consume the hook-provided `keyboardOpen` and viewport values; no consumer-specific behavior needed to change.

## Update — FN-512 (2026-09-17)

The restore *contract* above is unchanged and still enforced: returning from background with the
keyboard collapsed must clear the stale open-keyboard state even while the input keeps focus, and a
genuinely still-open restored keyboard must stay open.

The *mechanism* changed. The per-hook listeners, the timed tail
(50/200/500/1000/1500 ms) and the per-instance stability poll described above were replaced by one
shared subscription in `packages/dashboard/app/utils/mobileKeyboardViewport.ts`, which deduplicates
identical frames and runs a single bounded, cancellable stabilization poll. `pageshow` and
`visibilitychange` remain distinct sampling paths that force a fresh sample plus a re-settle.

The collapsed-restore special case is now largely structural rather than a bypass: a frame reporting a
visual height that already fills the layout viewport **cannot** also carry a positive `offsetTop`, so
that leftover offset is normalized to zero at read time. A stale restore sample therefore resolves into
a coherent full-height rectangle on its own, instead of needing the impossible-sample hold to be
suspended for it. Placement values are read from that rectangle; the cached baseline is now used only
for keyboard *detection* and never contributes placement pixels.

See [`mobile-keyboard-single-viewport-owner.md`](mobile-keyboard-single-viewport-owner.md) for the
full measurement rule and the single-owner contract.
