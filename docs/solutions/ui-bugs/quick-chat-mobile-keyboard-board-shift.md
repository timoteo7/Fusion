# Quick Chat mobile keyboard board shift

## Problem

Quick Chat's mobile UI is a fullscreen fixed sheet that covers the board and manages its own keyboard viewport with `--vv-height` and `--vv-offset-top`. App-level mobile keyboard logic did not know that sheet was open, so the Quick Chat composer keyboard was treated like an inline board keyboard.

On iOS, `computeMobileBarKeyboardFlags` returned `footerHidden: true` whenever `isMobile`, `keyboardOpen`, and `!anyModalOpen` were true. `App.tsx` mapped that to `mobileKeyboardOpen`, which removed `project-content--with-footer` / `project-content--with-mobile-nav` and hid the footer. Because Quick Chat is not part of `modalManager.anyModalOpen`, the board behind the sheet shifted up and could remain offset after iOS keyboard dismissal lag.

## Solution

Model fullscreen mobile overlays as explicit board-layout suppressors in `computeMobileBarKeyboardFlags`.

- Keep existing modal suppression intact.
- Add an `overlayOpen` input and suppress only `footerHidden` when `anyModalOpen || overlayOpen` is true.
- Preserve `navKeyboardOpen` and `footerKeyboardOpen` semantics so mobile nav/footer keyboard classes continue to reflect keyboard state where needed.
- In `App.tsx`, pass `overlayOpen: isMobile && quickChatOpen` so only Quick Chat's mobile fullscreen sheet suppresses board layout. Desktop Quick Chat remains unaffected.

This keeps the board's footer/mobile-nav padding classes present for the entire time Quick Chat is open. The board therefore never shifts in response to the Quick Chat keyboard, leaving nothing to snap back after the overlay closes.

## Related viewport-smoothing pitfall

FN-6498 found a separate Quick Chat viewport-tracking jank source inside `QuickChatFAB.tsx`: mobile `visualViewport` `resize` and `scroll` events can report the same `{ height, offsetTop }` sample during one keyboard animation tick, especially on Android Chrome with `interactive-widget=resizes-content`. The sheet should still own `--vv-height` / `--vv-offset-top`, but same-sample writes are deduped so the overlay does not add redundant style/layout invalidation while the board-shift suppression described above keeps the board underneath stable.

FN-6757 extends that mitigation for Android Chrome's distinct resize-content samples. When `visualViewport.height` shrinks below the stable layout viewport and `offsetTop` stays `0`, Quick Chat adds a height-only smoothing class so the fullscreen sheet eases through the keyboard animation instead of visibly stepping through every browser sample. The actual `--vv-height` writes remain synchronous and deduped, so the final sample is authoritative and FN-6503's Android `focusin` tail can still converge on late keyboard geometry. Non-zero `offsetTop` samples (the iOS keyboard path) do not enable smoothing because the sheet's translateY alignment must track the visual viewport immediately.

## Regression coverage

Cover the invariant at the pure helper seam:

- iOS + mobile + keyboard + no overlay still hides the footer for inline board keyboards.
- iOS + mobile + keyboard + modal keeps the footer visible.
- iOS + mobile + keyboard + fullscreen overlay keeps the footer visible.
- Android + mobile + keyboard + fullscreen overlay keeps `footerHidden` false while preserving nav keyboard state.
- Non-mobile remains all-false.

Prefer this narrow helper coverage over mock-heavy `App` rendering unless a future regression needs DOM-level evidence. `computeMobileBarKeyboardFlags` has a single production caller in `App.tsx`, making the seam small and reliable.

## Update — FN-512 (2026-09-17)

The isolation requirement in this document is unchanged: a fullscreen overlay's keyboard must never
shift the board behind it, and board-layout padding stays settled while a modal or fullscreen overlay
owns the viewport (`computeMobileBarKeyboardFlags`' `boardLayoutSuppressed`).

Two updates to the surrounding mechanism:

- The Quick Chat sheet itself no longer exists as a separate mobile host. The current owners of that
  isolation are `MobileDrawer`, `FloatingWindow`, and `TerminalModal`; Chat is hosted content inside
  them. Treat the host list here as historical and follow the owners named in
  [`mobile-keyboard-single-viewport-owner.md`](mobile-keyboard-single-viewport-owner.md).
- A hosting overlay no longer manages its viewport by writing `--vv-height`/`--vv-offset-top` and
  translating itself. It measures its own rectangle against the shared visible bound and caps its
  height, and it declares ownership so nested content does not adjust a second time. Adding a fresh
  `--vv-*` writer to a mobile surface is the anti-pattern this fix removed.
