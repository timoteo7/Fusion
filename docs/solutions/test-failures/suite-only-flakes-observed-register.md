# Observed suite-only flakes register

This register preserves first-sighting evidence under the narrow exception in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md#standing-rule-flaky-tests-are-quarantined-on-sight-deletion-ratchet), and merge-gate eviction records. An eviction record documents a gate flake removed from the blocking canary list while coverage continues in the non-blocking lane. It is not a quarantine: the normal default remains a ledger entry plus matching Vitest `exclude` in the same commit.

## 1. Project identity returns no stored identity

- **File:** `packages/core/src/__tests__/postgres/project-identity.test.ts`
- **Exact test:** `project-identity async (PostgreSQL integration) > returns null when no identity is stored`
- **Observed tree/SHA:** `origin/main` at `7927c7b58a`
- **Observed frequency:** 1-in-3 full-core-suite runs.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| full core suite (1st) | **1 failed** / 4824 passed |
| full core suite (2nd) | 4825 passed |
| full core suite (3rd) | 4825 passed |
| file alone ×2 | 6 passed, 6 passed |

## 2. Schema applier retains registered dependents

- **File:** `packages/core/src/__tests__/postgres/schema-applier.test.ts`
- **Exact test:** `schema-applier: VAL-SCHEMA-001 final-schema parity (table counts) > retains unreplaced registered dependents for every delete action`
- **Observed tree/SHA:** PR [#2828](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion/pull/2828) merged-with-main.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| full core suite on #2828 merged-with-main | **failed** |
| file alone ×2 on the same tree | 75 passed, 75 passed |
| file alone on `origin/main` | passed |

## 3. Plugin runner complete-lane lifecycle hook

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/__tests__/plugin-runner.test.ts`
- **Exact test:** `PluginRunner > task lifecycle hooks > should invoke onTaskCompleted when the complete lane is RENAMED`
- **Observed tree/SHA:** PR [#2799](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion/pull/2799) merged-with-main.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| full engine suite on #2799 merged-with-main (1st) | **8 failed** (7 in this file + 1 inherited) |
| full engine suite, same tree (2nd) | 1 failed (the inherited one only) |
| file alone | 80 passed |
| full engine suite on `origin/main` ×2 | clean |

Seven tests failed in `plugin-runner.test.ts`, but only this one identity survived capture: `--reporter=dot | tail -3` truncated the `FAIL` lines and retained only the summary.

## 4. Planning Mode direct task handoff

- **File:** `packages/dashboard/app/components/__tests__/PlanningModeModal.planning-flow.test.tsx`
- **Exact test:** `PlanningModeModal sequential flow > creates the task directly and offers task and session-list handoffs`
- **Observed tree/SHA:** `4e21f53996` (FN-8757 worktree)
- **Observed frequency:** first observation in the targeted file run.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| targeted file run | **1 failed** / 56 passed; `mockCreateTaskFromPlanning` was not called and jsdom reported unimplemented `window.scrollTo()` |
| isolated exact test | passed |

The failure is unrelated to the mobile question footer: it exercises the completed-plan Proceed handoff, while FN-8757 changes only the active-question footer. The file retains substantial coverage, so this first sighting is recorded rather than quarantined; a second sighting requires the normal file-level quarantine.

**Superseded 2026-08-10 (FN-8936):** The second sighting moved the file to the deletion-ratchet ledger. Investigation classified the direct handoff as a detached test-node hydration race, not a product create-state race; the suite was rescued by settling hydration and re-querying the live Proceed action before every previously unsafe direct click. The ledger and Vitest exclusion were removed together after exact and loaded-file proof, without timeout/retry/assertion appeasement.

## 5. Planning Mode mobile plan-tab selection

- **File:** `packages/dashboard/app/components/__tests__/PlanningModeModal.planning-flow.test.tsx`
- **Exact test:** `PlanningModeModal sequential flow > uses full-view Questions and Plan preview tabs on mobile`
- **Observed tree/SHA:** `main` at `4ff41a723c` with the Planning Mode task-creation fix uncommitted.
- **Observed frequency:** first observation in a targeted three-file dashboard run.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| targeted three-file dashboard run | **1 failed** / 198 passed; React reported an update outside `act(...)`, and the Plan tab still had `aria-selected="false"` immediately after `fireEvent.click` |

The failure exercises the pre-existing mobile tab transition, while the task-creation fix changes the completed-plan Proceed handoff. The file retains substantial coverage, so this first sighting is recorded rather than quarantined; a second sighting requires the normal file-level quarantine.

**Suite re-admitted 2026-08-10 (FN-8936):** This first-sighting mobile observation did not receive a second failure. The shared file-level quarantine was removed only after the direct-handoff root cause was structurally fixed and the unexcluded loaded suite, including this mobile coverage, passed.

## Common shape and unverified suspicion

Entries 1–3 are PostgreSQL-backed or PostgreSQL-suite-adjacent, pass in isolation, and appeared only under full-suite parallelism. This points at shared database state between those test files rather than any one test. It is **unverified and uninvestigated**, not a diagnosis; do not infer a root-cause fix from this record. Entry 6 instead records a merge-gate eviction after a loaded-lane setup-hook timeout; `FNXC:PgTestTemplateDb 2026-07-19-17:20` and `FNXC:PgTestWorkerCap 2026-07-18-18:00` are already-landed mitigations for that mode, not new diagnoses to re-open. The Planning Mode entries are separate frontend timing observations.

## Policy and escalation

Quarantine is file-level, while the first-sighting exception preserves coverage in files retaining 6 / 75 / 80 passing tests. Under that exception, recording preserves valuable coverage. A **second sighting** of a registered test is an on-sight quarantine: add it to `scripts/lib/test-quarantine.json` and the matching Vitest `exclude` in one lockstep commit; this register entry is then evidence for the ledger `reason`.

Merge-gate eviction records follow a separate branch: the gate can no longer be reddened by that file, while the non-blocking suite retains coverage. A further failure there is an ordinary on-sight quarantine. For PostgreSQL files, the gate-policy assertion forbidding a core-config quarantine exclude makes that an owner decision escalated as its own task rather than an inline edit.

Capture **full runner output** before recording or quarantining a failure—for example, tee it to a file. Never pipe a dot reporter through `tail`: the summary survives while the `FAIL` identity lines needed for a quarantine entry are exactly what gets truncated.

## 6. Sync workflow IR default canary setup hook

- **File:** `packages/core/src/__tests__/postgres/sync-workflow-ir-is-always-default.pg.test.ts`
- **Exact test:** `resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync ignores a task's real workflow (PostgreSQL)` suite `beforeAll` setup hook.
- **Observed tree/SHA:** FN-8912 evidence; local confirmation tree `51437558ac352dad3481e0dbe9622fa51af4c599`.
- **Observed frequency:** 1 observed merge-gate sighting in FN-8912; not reproduced locally. This is an **evicted merge-gate canary**, not a first-sighting register exception.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| FN-8912 loaded `pnpm test:gate` | **setup hook timed out** at the inherited 15s budget; direct scoped rerun passed |
| shape A: capped `test:pg-gate` ×5 | 3 files / 13 tests passed each run |
| shape B: isolated target ×3 | 1 file / 3 tests passed each run |
| shape C: uncapped default-config PostgreSQL directory ×5 | 153 files / 1263 passed plus 1 skipped each run |

FN-8928 evicted the file from the blocking gate under the AGENTS.md gate rule; default-core discovery preserves its regression coverage. Shape C was clean, so no quarantine escalation was required. A later non-blocking-core failure is an ordinary on-sight quarantine decision. `FNXC:PgTestTemplateDb 2026-07-19-17:20` (run-shared golden template) and `FNXC:PgTestWorkerCap 2026-07-18-18:00` (four-fork PG-gate cap) are already-landed mitigations for this same 15s setup-hook timeout mode.

## 7. Mission store PostgreSQL teardown hook

- **File:** `packages/core/src/__tests__/postgres/mission-store.pg.test.ts`
- **Exact test:** `MissionStore (PostgreSQL backend mode)` suite `afterAll` hook (`h.afterAll`).
- **Observed tree/SHA:** `32f677bbc207e421fd260ae2ba22fcefeeef4d86` (FN-8979 worktree).
- **Observed frequency:** first observation in a direct targeted rerun; 61 tests in the file passed.

| run | result |
|---|---|
| targeted file with `--silent=passed-only` | passed (exit 0) |
| targeted file with dot reporter | **afterAll hook timed out** at 15s; 61 tests passed |

The timeout occurred after all test assertions and is unrelated to FN-8979's canonical mission-blocker contract. This file retains substantial coverage, so this first observation is recorded rather than quarantined. A second sighting requires the normal file-level quarantine decision.
