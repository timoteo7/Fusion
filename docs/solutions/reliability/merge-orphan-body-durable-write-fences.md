## Mechanism

`ProjectEngine.awaitPriorMergeBodySettle()` bounds how long the merge lane waits. A body that ignores a cooperative abort may still run after that wait while a successor owns a fresh signal. FN-8912 correctly fences `writeTransientMergeStatus`: an aborted signal resolves without calling `updateTask`. It intentionally did not fence diagnostics or finalization.

This FN-8923 inventory is complete **only over the pinned closure and pinned writer surface with declared boundaries**. It does not claim coverage of the whole engine. No UI affordance is involved. Orphan log writes can refresh `updatedAt`, affecting age-based recovery; that recovery-policy question remains FN-8924.

## Derived writer surface and closure

The shared TypeScript-AST helper reads `packages/core/src/store.ts` and extracts the public `TaskStore` surface. Its durable surface includes every classified state-mutating method — including attachment, archive, atomic-update, task/workflow creation, deletion, recovery, lifecycle, and upsert operations — rather than only the methods currently seen in merge code. The complete method-by-method writer/non-writer classification (with reasons) is pinned as `writerSurfaceClassification` in `merge-orphan-durable-write-inventory.json` and compared to the AST result by the drift guard; an unclassified public method fails the guard. `markTaskWedgeNotificationPending` and `clearTaskWedgeNotificationPending` are writers because they respectively persist and remove deferred `wedgeNotification.pending` evidence through `updateTaskAtomic`. Module-level writers `finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask` and `syncGroupPrOnLanding` are explicit extras. The pinned classification currently covers 559 public methods and yields 274 writers.

The walked closure is the sorted `scannedModules` list in the checked-in manifest. It is derived by following first-party emitted `.js` imports back to their TypeScript source, and currently includes 323 modules, including `packages/engine/src/merge/auto-merge-finalization.ts`, `packages/engine/src/merge/push-after-merge-policy.ts`, `packages/engine/src/worktree/workspace-base-refresh.ts`, and the run-audit/branch-group helpers. There are no declared closure boundaries: the walk runs to fixpoint. The alias rule normalizes single-assignment `store`/`options.store` aliases; computed or destructured access becomes a fail-closed suspect.

## Reconciled frontier

FN-9221 re-synchronizes this inventory after the import closure gained new modules and durable writes.
Fence-wrapped workspace-finalization logs are backed by their local MergeWriteFence call, while the explicit no-fence branches remain unresolved under FN-8958; newly reached base-refresh writes have no call edge from the merge entry points and remain out of frontier.

FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-09-30-12:56:
FUSI-021 classifies the four public TaskStore methods the 0084 overlap-wait work added, which is
what had been keeping this guard red for five tests: the guard refuses at
`assertInventoryRegenerationInputs` on unclassified methods BEFORE it compares anything, so all eight
assertions were silently dead and no other entry was being policed.
`claimTaskOverlapWait`, `completeTaskOverlapWait`, and `publishTaskOverlapDeliveries` are writers:
all three run `layer.transactionImmediate` against `schema.project.taskOverlapWaits`. Claim and
complete additionally take `acquireTaskAdvisoryXactLock`; publish does not, and instead relies on an
optimistic-concurrency `revision` compare-and-set, which is why it is called out separately in the
classification comment. Complete is the only one of the three that touches a second durable table
(it appends a dedupe-keyed `schema.project.tasks.log` release entry).
`listTaskOverlapWaits` is the one genuine non-writer: a single `layer.db.select()` with no
transaction and no persistence, the same shape as the `getProjectId` precedent. It is deliberately
NOT made a writer conservatively the way `listLearningProposals` is, because unlike the learning
read it has no merge-frontier caller, so fencing it would protect nothing.
This regeneration also re-synchronized the structural fields the 0084 drift had left stale:
scannedModules 228->323, entries 343->393 (52 added, 2 removed), writerSurface 271->274, and
writerSurfaceClassification 555->559. The two removed rows are the pre-hardening
`auto-merge-finalization` `store.updateTask`/`store.moveTask` call sites, superseded by the
`updateTaskAtomic`/`moveTaskIf` rows recorded as checkpoint-covered/already-fenced. The genuinely
new frontier rows are those two hardened calls plus the three reroute
`store.seedWorkspaceCodeReviewContinuationIfIdle` sites in `pre-merge-gate-reseed.ts` and
`stale-content-review-reroute.ts`, which are indeterminate/unresolved under FN-8958 because they seed
a durable workflow continuation with no local MergeWriteFence. All 48 other new rows are genuinely
off-path and take the out-of-frontier tuple; no pre-existing human verdict was rewritten.
-->

The manifest is final and keyed by AST-derived call-site id and argument-shape fingerprint. It contains 393 derived call sites across the pinned closure: 336 scanned-but-off-path rows are explicitly `out-of-frontier`, and the directly exercised transient-status leaf plus the locally fence-wrapped workspace-finalization logs are `already-fenced`. The remaining direct-body surfaces are `unresolved` rather than falsely declared fenced because the real exported body cannot yet isolate every call site without test-only production exports. Each `must-be-fenced` or unresolved surface needs the follow-up below.

The real-tail fixture additionally observes `packages/engine/src/merge/auto-merge-finalization.ts::finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask::store.updateTask::#2`, `packages/engine/src/merge/auto-merge-finalization.ts::finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask>moved::store.moveTask::#1`, and `packages/engine/src/merge/merger-ai.ts::finalizeTask>finalization::finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask::#1` as `checkpoint-gap / must-be-fenced / layerB-observed / positive-observation`; all are assigned to FN-8958.

The complete machine-readable table is `packages/engine/src/__tests__/fixtures/merge-orphan-durable-write-inventory.json`; this document lists the direct merger-body subset for navigation. No negative deep-body observation is treated as evidence without a witness.

## Out-of-frontier rows

The import closure intentionally includes modules pulled in by the legacy `aiMergeTask` pipeline and other independently owned engine subsystems. Their durable calls are retained in the manifest ratchet, but they have no call edge from `runAiMerge`, `landWorkspaceTask`, or `landOneRepo`; they are classified with the required `out-of-frontier` five-tuple rather than invented as unresolved orphan writes. This currently accounts for 336 entries, including all `packages/engine/src/merger.ts` legacy-pipeline writes, the `refreshReusedWorktreeBase>persistBaseSha` update, the workspace base-refresh persistence and skipped-refresh log, and the three overlap-wait writes. The remaining 57 entries are the direct merger-body modules (`merger-ai.ts`, `auto-merge-finalization.ts`, `pre-merge-gate-reseed.ts`, `stale-content-review-reroute.ts`, `workspace-land-failure.ts`, `lifecycle-move.ts`, and the `createRunAuditor` surface); each remains in the frontier and is separately classified in the manifest.

The overlap-wait rows are a deliberate case. `packages/engine/src/workflows/overlap-plan-revalidation.ts` enters the closure transitively, but its only importers are `agent-heartbeat.ts` and `executor/execute-workflow-graph.ts`, and the same holds for the `merger.ts::aiMergeTask::store.publishTaskOverlapDeliveries` site in the soft-deprecated legacy pipeline. None of the three has a call edge from `runAiMerge`, `landWorkspaceTask`, or `landOneRepo`, so all three take the `out-of-frontier` five-tuple. A fourth reroute module, `packages/engine/src/merge/workspace-review-reroute.ts`, calls the same `store.seedWorkspaceCodeReviewContinuationIfIdle` seam but is imported only by `project-engine.ts`, which the merge entry walk never reaches; it is therefore absent from `scannedModules` and produces no call site at all. Its siblings `pre-merge-gate-reseed.ts` and `stale-content-review-reroute.ts` are also imported by `self-healing.ts`, which *is* in the closure, so those two do produce frontier rows. Whether a scan row exists is decided by reachability from the pinned entry, never by the presence of a durable write in the file.

## Characterization and competing generations

Layer A pins the essential condition: an orphan signal remains aborted while a successor has a distinct live signal. Layer B directly drives the real exported `writeTransientMergeStatus` leaf and proves its no-write behavior with direct-entry execution proof. Crucially, its real `runAiMerge` fixtures abort from the clean-room review, the post-CAS integration-ref audit, and the `mergeDetails` persistence seam: the same aborted body then positively writes `mergeDetails`, moves to the complete column, emits `task:merged`, appends merger logs, and records shared branch-group landing. Those writes are attributed from the recorder slice taken at abort and are `must-be-fenced`, not speculative risks. The attempted data states are pre-land, clean-room review, post-ref advance, post-merge-details, and workspace partial land; unisolatable deep rows are explicitly unresolved, not covered by a pre-aborted fixture.

The workspace fixture now lands `repo-a`, aborts from the real second-repository merge seam, and partitions recorder rows by generation while a distinct non-aborted successor signal performs its production status write. This proves the partial-land boundary is reached after a durable first-repo `landedSha` write, rather than aborting before the loop. The principal hazard is a stale body moving/finalizing the same task or refreshing its durable activity while the successor owns the task. Logs are not pre-classified benign: their `updatedAt` consequence is evidence for FN-8924.

## Regenerating the manifest

Use the explicit opt-in command:

```sh
FUSION_UPDATE_MERGE_INVENTORY=1 pnpm --filter @fusion/engine exec vitest run src/__tests__/merge-orphan-durable-write-inventory-drift.test.ts
```

Regeneration overwrites only derivable structure: writer surface and classification, reachable module closure, call-site identity/fingerprint/location/writer/ordinal, and line hint. It carries human judgement fields — lifecycle axes, evidence, observation, execution proof, ownership/data-state context, and follow-up — only when an exact `callSiteId` already exists. Removed call sites disappear. A newly derived call site receives `pending:classify`, which the guard deliberately rejects; reviewers must classify it before the inventory can be green. Regeneration also refuses unclassified TaskStore methods or unresolved receivers.

## Ratchet contract and enforcement

`_merge-durable-write-callsites.ts` is the sole derivation for manifest and guard. It pins closure, boundaries, writer source/surface, unique call-site ids, and fingerprints. The guard checks a bijection and fails closed on aliases it cannot prove. It intentionally never asserts `lineHint`. The final lifecycle requires real task ids for unresolved rows/boundaries and documented null markers for other dispositions.

The guard is not in the curated blocking `engine-core` merge gate. It runs when engine affected tests are selected by root `pnpm test`, and in the non-blocking full-suite push lane. It must not be described as a merge-blocking CI gate.

## Recommendation

Use a hybrid in FN-8958: retain cheap cooperative checkpoints around long git/agent awaits, but add generation authority to lifecycle-mutating durable writes (`updateTask`, `moveTask`, commit association, audit/finalization and `task:merged`). A generation guard protects future writes uniformly where a checkpoint cannot stop an already-resolved await. Decide `logEntry`/`appendAgentLog` separately with the recovery evidence; do not fence it speculatively.

A checkpoint-only fix is local but has gaps after unabortable awaits. A generation-only design is broader machinery. The hybrid gives lifecycle writes ownership protection while retaining responsive cancellation.
