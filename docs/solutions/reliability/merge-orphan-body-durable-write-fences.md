## Mechanism

`ProjectEngine.awaitPriorMergeBodySettle()` bounds how long the merge lane waits. A body that ignores a cooperative abort may still run after that wait while a successor owns a fresh signal. FN-8912 correctly fences `writeTransientMergeStatus`: an aborted signal resolves without calling `updateTask`. It intentionally did not fence diagnostics or finalization.

This FN-8923 inventory is complete **only over the pinned closure and pinned writer surface with declared boundaries**. It does not claim coverage of the whole engine. No UI affordance is involved. Orphan log writes can refresh `updatedAt`, affecting age-based recovery; that recovery-policy question remains FN-8924.

## Derived writer surface and closure

The shared TypeScript-AST helper reads `packages/core/src/store.ts` and extracts the public `TaskStore` surface. Its durable surface includes every classified state-mutating method — including attachment, archive, atomic-update, task/workflow creation, deletion, recovery, lifecycle, and upsert operations — rather than only the methods currently seen in merge code. The complete method-by-method writer/non-writer classification (with reasons) is pinned as `writerSurfaceClassification` in `merge-orphan-durable-write-inventory.json` and compared to the AST result by the drift guard; an unclassified public method fails the guard. `markTaskWedgeNotificationPending` and `clearTaskWedgeNotificationPending` are writers because they respectively persist and remove deferred `wedgeNotification.pending` evidence through `updateTaskAtomic`. Module-level writers `finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask` and `syncGroupPrOnLanding` are explicit extras.

The walked closure is the sorted `scannedModules` list in the checked-in manifest. It is derived by following first-party emitted `.js` imports back to their TypeScript source, and currently includes 332 modules, including `packages/engine/src/merge/auto-merge-finalization.ts`, `packages/engine/src/merge/post-merge-gate-reseed.ts`, `packages/engine/src/merge/push-after-merge-policy.ts`, `packages/engine/src/worktree/workspace-base-refresh.ts`, and the run-audit/branch-group helpers. There are no declared closure boundaries: the walk runs to fixpoint. The alias rule normalizes single-assignment `store`/`options.store` aliases; computed or destructured access becomes a fail-closed suspect.

## Reconciled frontier

<!--
FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-09-01-04:31:
FN-9221 re-synchronizes this inventory after the import closure gained new modules and durable writes.
Fence-wrapped workspace-finalization logs are backed by their local MergeWriteFence call, while the explicit no-fence branches remain unresolved under FN-8958; newly reached base-refresh writes have no call edge from the merge entry points and remain out of frontier.

FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-09-25-10:56:
FN-9397 reconciles the closure after triage imports the graph executor for held-planning cooldowns. Closure membership is not orphan-frontier reachability: all 22 graph/admission/IR-pin writes are entered only by independent task execution, with no call edge from `runAiMerge`, `landWorkspaceTask`, or `landOneRepo`.

FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-10-01-22:44:
FN-9446 reconciles the finalization-owned post-merge gate reseed. Its continuation insert is guarded by the captured task update timestamp and workflow selection, and merge finalization wraps the reseed in its finalization fence; its subsequent log follows only that accepted claim. The two call sites are therefore checkpoint-covered, not pending or an invented out-of-frontier exclusion.

<!--
FNXC:MergeReliability 2026-09-25-10:56:
The structural reconciler owns module and call-site discovery, while reviewers own lifecycle verdicts. A newly derived writer receives a deterministic pending classification; a new merger call edge to an existing entry requires reviewers to revisit its out-of-frontier verdict rather than treating closure membership as proof.
-->

The manifest is final and keyed by AST-derived call-site id and argument-shape fingerprint. It contains 418 derived call sites across the 332-module pinned closure: 359 scanned-but-off-path rows are explicitly `out-of-frontier`, including the 22 graph-execution, admission, and IR-pin writes exposed by the held-planning import path. Of the 59 frontier rows, 46 are `already-fenced`, 8 are `benign-unfenced`, and 5 remain `unresolved`. This includes the transient-status leaf, locally fence-wrapped workspace-finalization logs, and the checkpointed post-merge gate reseed. Unresolved direct-body surfaces remain explicitly unresolved because the real exported body cannot yet isolate every call site without test-only production exports. Each `must-be-fenced` or unresolved surface needs the follow-up below.

The real-tail fixture additionally observes `packages/engine/src/merge/auto-merge-finalization.ts::finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask::store.updateTask::#2`, `packages/engine/src/merge/auto-merge-finalization.ts::finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask>moved::store.moveTask::#1`, and `packages/engine/src/merge/merger-ai.ts::finalizeTask>finalization::finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask::#1` as `checkpoint-gap / must-be-fenced / layerB-observed / positive-observation`; all are assigned to FN-8958.

The complete machine-readable table is `packages/engine/src/__tests__/fixtures/merge-orphan-durable-write-inventory.json`; this document lists the direct merger-body subset for navigation. No negative deep-body observation is treated as evidence without a witness.

## Out-of-frontier rows

The import closure intentionally includes modules pulled in by the legacy `aiMergeTask` pipeline and other independently owned engine subsystems. Their durable calls are retained in the manifest ratchet, but they have no call edge from `runAiMerge`, `landWorkspaceTask`, or `landOneRepo`; they are classified with the required `out-of-frontier` five-tuple rather than invented as unresolved orphan writes. This currently accounts for 359 entries, including all `packages/engine/src/merger.ts` legacy-pipeline writes, the `refreshReusedWorktreeBase>persistBaseSha` update, workspace base-refresh persistence and skipped-refresh logging, and the 22 `executeWorkflowGraph`/admission/IR-pin rows exposed by the triage held-planning import. The remaining 59 entries are the direct merger-body modules (`merger-ai.ts`, `auto-merge-finalization.ts`, `post-merge-gate-reseed.ts`, and the `createRunAuditor` surface); each remains in the frontier and is separately classified in the manifest.

## Overlap-wait rows

The four public `TaskStore` methods the 0084 overlap-wait work added are classified on evidence rather than on naming, because the guard refuses at `assertInventoryRegenerationInputs` on unclassified methods BEFORE it compares anything: an unclassified row makes every other assertion silently dead.

`claimTaskOverlapWait`, `completeTaskOverlapWait`, and `publishTaskOverlapDeliveries` are writers. All three run `layer.transactionImmediate` against `schema.project.taskOverlapWaits`, so each is durable on its own semantics — not on who calls it — because an orphaned merge body that reaches one of them would have reached the durable frontier. Claim and complete additionally take `acquireTaskAdvisoryXactLock`; publish does not, and instead relies on an optimistic-concurrency `revision` compare-and-set, which is why it is called out separately. Complete is the only one of the three that touches a second durable table, appending a dedupe-keyed `schema.project.tasks.log` release entry.

`listTaskOverlapWaits` is the one genuine non-writer: a single `layer.db.select()` with no transaction and no persistence, the same shape as the `getProjectId` precedent. It is deliberately NOT made a writer conservatively the way `listLearningProposals` is. The learning-ledger read sits on a read frontier a future orphaned merge body could plausibly reach, and erring toward fencing is the safe default when a subsystem is new. The overlap-wait read has no merge-frontier caller at all — its callers are the overlap workflow and the merger, none of which an orphaned merge body reaches. Keeping it a non-writer is therefore both honest and not a coverage loss: fencing it would protect nothing. If a future change gives it a merge-path caller, the correct move is to revisit that row, and the guard's `unclassified`/drift assertions will surface the new call site.

## Characterization and competing generations

Layer A pins the essential condition: an orphan signal remains aborted while a successor has a distinct live signal. Layer B directly drives the real exported `writeTransientMergeStatus` leaf and proves its no-write behavior with direct-entry execution proof. Crucially, its real `runAiMerge` fixtures abort from the clean-room review, the post-CAS integration-ref audit, and the `mergeDetails` persistence seam: the same aborted body then positively writes `mergeDetails`, moves to the complete column, emits `task:merged`, appends merger logs, and records shared branch-group landing. Those writes are attributed from the recorder slice taken at abort and are `must-be-fenced`, not speculative risks. The attempted data states are pre-land, clean-room review, post-ref advance, post-merge-details, and workspace partial land; unisolatable deep rows are explicitly unresolved, not covered by a pre-aborted fixture.

The workspace fixture now lands `repo-a`, aborts from the real second-repository merge seam, and partitions recorder rows by generation while a distinct non-aborted successor signal performs its production status write. This proves the partial-land boundary is reached after a durable first-repo `landedSha` write, rather than aborting before the loop. The principal hazard is a stale body moving/finalizing the same task or refreshing its durable activity while the successor owns the task. Logs are not pre-classified benign: their `updatedAt` consequence is evidence for FN-8924.

## Regenerating the manifest

Use the explicit opt-in command:

```sh
FUSION_UPDATE_MERGE_INVENTORY=1 pnpm --filter @fusion/engine exec vitest run src/__tests__/merge-orphan-durable-write-inventory-drift.test.ts
```

Regeneration overwrites only derivable structure: writer surface and classification, reachable module closure, call-site identity/fingerprint/location/writer/ordinal, and line hint. It carries human judgement fields — lifecycle axes, evidence, observation, execution proof, ownership/data-state context, and follow-up — only when an exact `callSiteId` already exists. Removed call sites disappear. A newly derived call site receives `pending:classify`, which the guard deliberately rejects; reviewers must classify it before the inventory can be green. Regeneration also refuses unclassified TaskStore methods or unresolved receivers.

## Ratchet contract and enforcement

`_merge-durable-write-callsites.ts` is the sole derivation for manifest and guard. It pins closure, boundaries, writer source/surface, unique call-site ids, and fingerprints. The guard checks a bijection and fails closed on aliases it cannot prove. It intentionally never asserts `lineHint`. The final lifecycle requires real task ids for unresolved rows/boundaries and documented null markers for other dispositions.

The guard is not in the curated blocking `engine-core` merge gate. It runs when engine affected tests are selected by root `pnpm test`, and in the non-blocking full-suite push lane. It must not be described as a merge-blocking CI gate.

## Recommendation

Use a hybrid in FN-8958: retain cheap cooperative checkpoints around long git/agent awaits, but add generation authority to lifecycle-mutating durable writes (`updateTask`, `moveTask`, commit association, audit/finalization and `task:merged`). A generation guard protects future writes uniformly where a checkpoint cannot stop an already-resolved await. Decide `logEntry`/`appendAgentLog` separately with the recovery evidence; do not fence it speculatively.

A checkpoint-only fix is local but has gaps after unabortable awaits. A generation-only design is broader machinery. The hybrid gives lifecycle writes ownership protection while retaining responsive cancellation.
