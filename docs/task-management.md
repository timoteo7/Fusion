# Task Management

[← Docs index](./README.md)

This guide covers task creation, lifecycle behavior, task metadata, and operational workflows.

## Task Creation Options

### 1) Quick Entry (dashboard)

Use the inline input on board/list view:

- Type description
- Press Enter
- Task is created in `planning`

### Duplicate-task detection at creation time (Quick Entry)

Dashboard `POST /tasks` now performs a pre-create duplicate gate using token-overlap similarity against recent non-done tasks (default threshold `0.45`, excluding `done`/`archived`).

- `POST /api/tasks/duplicate-check` accepts `{ title?, description, limit?, threshold? }` and returns `{ matches }` for UI preflight warnings.
- `POST /api/tasks` accepts optional `acknowledgedDuplicates?: string[]` and `bypassDuplicateCheck?: boolean`.
  - If candidates remain after acknowledgement filtering, the route returns `409` with `{ error: "duplicate_candidates", details: { matches } }`.
  - If `bypassDuplicateCheck: true`, the gate is skipped.
- When creation proceeds with acknowledged candidates, created task metadata stores:
  - `task.source.sourceMetadata.duplicateWarningOverridden = true`
  - `task.source.sourceMetadata.acknowledgedDuplicateIds = [...]`
- Override creates emit activity type `task:duplicate-warning-overridden` with acknowledged IDs and scored candidate metadata.
- Duplicate lineage is persisted on the task row via canonical source fields (`sourceType: "task_duplicate"`, `sourceParentTaskId`) plus `sourceMetadata.duplicateOfTaskIds` when available, so `fn task show <id>` and Task Detail views can render duplicate-of linkage directly from task provenance.

#### Deterministic duplicate guard (FN-4918, extended by FN-5060)

Fusion applies a deterministic guard for exact normalized content matches (title + description fingerprint) within a 60s window. The shared implementation lives in `packages/core/src/duplicate-guard.ts` (`runDeterministicDuplicateGuard` + `reconcileDeterministicDuplicate`) and is wired into all primary task-creation surfaces:

- Dashboard `POST /tasks`
- CLI `fn task create` (`runTaskCreate`)
- Engine `createAgentTask` (powers `fn_task_create`, including triage subtask splits)
- Mission feature triage (`MissionStore.triageFeature`)

Behavior is consistent across these surfaces:

- If an existing same-fingerprint task is found in-window, create returns/behaves as a link-to-existing result (`duplicate_candidates` for API, `Linked existing ...` for CLI/tool responses).
- If two creates race across processes and both reach persistence, post-create reconciliation keeps the older canonical task and auto-archives the newer sibling.
- New rows stamp `task.source.sourceMetadata.contentFingerprint` for deterministic matching.
- Reconciled losers stamp `task.source.sourceMetadata.deterministicDuplicateOf = <canonicalTaskId>` and are archived (not deleted).
- Reconciliation archives record activity event `task:auto-archived-deterministic-duplicate`.

Bypass controls:

- Dashboard API: `bypassDuplicateCheck: true` skips deterministic + similarity duplicate gates.
- CLI: `fn task create --no-dedup` skips deterministic duplicate guard.

This deterministic layer complements (does not replace) the FN-4829 similarity warning gate. FN-4892 remains a separate engine-side same-agent intake heuristic at triage finalize.

##### Fail-open boundary (FN-5084)

The deterministic **pre-check** now fails open: transient store query failures, in-process mutex bookkeeping failures, and leader-lock promise rejections do not block task creation. The route logs one `runtimeLogger.warn` line tagged `FN-5084` (including `projectId` and `contentFingerprint`) and continues through the FN-4829 similarity gate to normal create handling.

Only legitimate deterministic duplicate detections continue to propagate as `409` via `ApiError` from `conflict("duplicate_candidates", ...)`. The post-create FN-4918 reconciliation pass remains the second line of defense.

#### Near-duplicate intent guard (FN-5152)

Fusion adds a separate near-duplicate layer for tasks whose raw descriptions differ but whose implementation intent converges.

Order on dashboard `POST /api/tasks` is:

1. Deterministic fingerprint guard (FN-4918 / FN-5060)
2. Similarity warning gate (FN-4829)
3. Near-duplicate intent guard (FN-5152)

Both FN-5152 layers **fail open**: extraction errors, store-query failures, parse failures, and timeout paths log a warning and continue through normal create/finalize flow.

Layer 1 runs synchronously on dashboard intake before task creation. It extracts an intent signature from the incoming title/description and compares it with active recent tasks. The signature stores four capped arrays:

- `routePaths` — route-like paths such as `/pr/options` or `/api/tasks/:id/pr/preflight`
- `filePaths` — concrete source/docs paths such as `packages/dashboard/src/routes/register-task-workflow-routes.ts`
- `identifiers` — high-signal identifier-shaped tokens such as `PrCreateModal`
- `titleTokens` — non-stopword title tokens used for the title Jaccard check

When at least two distinct high-signal tokens overlap and title-token Jaccard is at least `0.30`, dashboard intake returns `409 duplicate_candidates` with matches carrying `reason: "near-duplicate-intent"` plus `sharedTokens` so callers can explain the overlap. Clients may bypass that specific match with `acknowledgedDuplicates: ["FN-..."]`; `bypassDuplicateCheck: true` still skips the create-time duplicate gates entirely.

To avoid false positives from broad hot files, the matcher treats an overlap consisting only of generic large files (`register-git-github.ts`, `register-task-workflow-routes.ts`, `store.ts`, `types.ts`, `styles.css`) more strictly and requires title-token Jaccard of at least `0.50`.

Layer 1 persists `source.sourceMetadata.intentSignature` on created tasks so later checks can reuse pre-extracted vectors.

##### CLI direct-store coverage (FN-5171)

CLI `fn task create` now runs the same near-duplicate intent guard after the FN-4918 deterministic fingerprint guard, using shared `extractIntentSignature` / `findNearDuplicates` helpers from `@fusion/core`. Thresholds and the 7-day comparison window match the dashboard layer exactly. `--no-dedup` remains the single bypass across both duplicate layers: it skips the comparison but still stamps `source.sourceMetadata.intentSignature` when high-signal tokens were extracted. When a near-duplicate is detected, interactive TTY runs prompt `Create anyway? [y/N]`; non-interactive runs refuse creation with exit code 1 and instruct the caller to re-run with `--no-dedup`. The guard is still fail-open: extraction/list/query errors log a warning and continue. `fn task import` (GitHub import) and `fn task plan` intentionally continue to skip both duplicate guards per the FN-5060 same-content-sibling contract.

Layer 2 runs in triage `finalizeApprovedTask` after `PROMPT.md` is written and parses `## File Scope` as an additional backstop. If the new spec overlaps an older active task on concrete File Scope / intent tokens and still clears the title threshold, the newer task is flagged for user confirmation instead of being silently auto-archived.

Near-duplicate flagging now keeps the task in its normal flow column (`todo` / approval flow) and records metadata for UI warnings:

- `source.sourceMetadata.nearDuplicateOf = <canonicalTaskId>`
- `source.sourceMetadata.nearDuplicateScore = <number>`
- `source.sourceMetadata.nearDuplicateSharedTokens = <string[]>`
- optional `source.sourceMetadata.nearDuplicateDismissed = true` after user chooses Keep
- activity event `task:near-duplicate-flagged`

A near-duplicate flag is only actionable while the canonical task is active. The triage backstop does not persist `nearDuplicateOf` for archived, soft-deleted, done, or missing canonicals; when a canonical later becomes inactive through archive, soft-delete, or move-to-done, the store clears `nearDuplicateOf`, `nearDuplicateScore`, `nearDuplicateSharedTokens`, and `nearDuplicateDismissed` from active referrers and records an informational log entry without pausing or failing those tasks.

Dashboard surfaces this as a yellow Duplicate chip plus modal actions only while the canonical exists and is active:

- **Archive** (user-initiated archive path)
- **Keep** (dismisses the warning by setting `nearDuplicateDismissed: true`)

This layer complements, rather than replaces, FN-4829 similarity detection, FN-4918 deterministic deduplication, and FN-4892 same-agent intake heuristics.

### Workspace worktree cleanup on archive

Archiving a workspace (multi-repository) task now synchronously removes every recorded per-sub-repository worktree, including archives initiated by `fn_task_archive` and CLI paths that do not construct an executor. Each path is protected by a per-repository cross-process reservation until backend removal and branch cleanup finish. If one removal fails, its reservation is quarantined and the next acquisition reconciles that orphan; successful sibling repositories are still released. `archiveTask(..., { cleanup: false })` intentionally retains worktrees, and the self-healing workspace sweep remains an idempotent backstop.

### Task-pinned orphan recovery

When `worktreeNaming: "task-id"` finds an inactive pinned directory whose Git metadata is incomplete or unregistered, Fusion preserves the whole directory before recreating the task worktree at the same path. The normal preservation root is `<project>/.fusion/recovery/worktrees`. If the configured worktree directory is on another filesystem, Fusion retries the atomic rename under `<worktreesDir>/.fusion-recovery/worktrees` instead of using copy-and-delete.

Each preservation root retains the newest 10 Fusion-generated orphan directories. Pruning is best-effort and skips unknown names, symlinks, unreadable entries, and paths with active sessions. Copy artifacts elsewhere if they need indefinite retention. Worktree discovery, cleanup, and capacity scans treat `.fusion-recovery` as an internal container rather than a task worktree.

### Explicit duplicate-marker guard (FN-5220)

Fusion also recognizes the canonical one-line redirect marker:

- `DUPLICATE: FN-1234`
- `` `DUPLICATE: FN-1234` ``
- `**DUPLICATE: FN-1234**`
- fenced single-line wrappers such as:

  ```text
  DUPLICATE: FN-1234
  ```

The shared parser lives in `packages/core/src/explicit-duplicate-marker.ts` (`parseExplicitDuplicateMarker`). It is intentionally strict: after trimming outer whitespace and one optional wrapper layer, the content must reduce to exactly one substantive line matching `^DUPLICATE:\s*FN-\d+$`. Any extra prose, multiple markers, or full PROMPT bodies that merely mention duplicate text are ignored.

This guard adds three fail-open layers on top of the existing duplicate stack, in final order:

1. Deterministic fingerprint guard (FN-4918 / FN-5060)
2. Similarity warning gate (FN-4829)
3. Near-duplicate intent guard (FN-5152)
4. Explicit duplicate-marker guard (FN-5220)

Layer behavior:

- **Dashboard intake (`POST /api/tasks`)** — after deterministic/similarity/near-duplicate checks and before `createTask`, intake returns `409 duplicate_candidates` with `reason: "explicit-marker"` when the combined title/description is exactly a canonical redirect and the canonical target exists. `acknowledgedDuplicates` and `bypassDuplicateCheck: true` both suppress the conflict. Because this guard runs before task creation, the activity breadcrumb is attached to the canonical target.
- **Triage planning loop** — after triage reads the generated `PROMPT.md`, an exact redirect marker short-circuits directly into `finalizeApprovedTask()`. Normal plans run deterministic spec hygiene checks in triage, then the selected workflow's optional Plan Review gate owns AI plan review before execution.
- **Self-healing sweep** — maintenance Batch 2 runs `resolveExplicitDuplicateMarkerTasks()` across `triage`/`todo` tasks to clean up older stuck marker tasks. The sweep is best-effort, capped at 50 marker tasks per cycle, and can be disabled with the internal setting `resolveExplicitDuplicateMarkerEnabled: false` (default `true`).

An operator's decision is durable for a task and its active canonical pair. **Keep** records the acknowledgement, clears the marker-only prompt and triage decision hold, and lets planning continue; triage and self-healing will not ask again if that same marker is reprocessed. A marker for a different active canonical remains a new decision. **Delete** for an explicit-marker decision soft-deletes the duplicate, while **Archive** for an ordinary near-duplicate leaves it terminal in Archived; neither outcome is reopened as a duplicate decision.

All three layers fail open: parse errors, task lookup failures, file-read failures, activity-recording errors, or other unexpected exceptions log a warning and continue normal intake/triage/self-healing flow instead of blocking task creation or recovery.

Activity uses the existing `task:auto-archived-duplicate` event with `metadata.source` disambiguators:

- `explicit-marker` — triage short-circuit / duplicate finalize path
- `explicit-marker-sweep` — self-healing maintenance sweep
- `explicit-marker-intake` — dashboard intake rejection breadcrumb

The duplicate-close task log line remains `Duplicate of <canonicalTaskId> — closed` for triage/sweep paths.

### Intake auto-archive (ghost-bug preflight + same-agent duplicate)

Fusion applies two conservative intake heuristics that may auto-archive newly filed tasks before execution starts:

- **Ghost-bug preflight** (triage finalize path): for bug-fix-shaped specs that cite concrete constructs/commands, Fusion probes current `main`. If all definitive probes show the cited bug does not reproduce, the task is archived as `auto-resolved-ghost-bug`.
- **Same-agent duplicate intake** (all task-create backends): if the same `source.sourceAgentId` (or `source.sourceParentTaskId`) filed a highly similar task within 24h (threshold `0.75`), Fusion still detects the near-duplicate — but what happens next depends on the `autoArchiveDuplicateTasksEnabled` project/global setting (default **`false`**, FN-7658/FN-8401):
  - **Default (`false`)**: the later task is left in place and flagged via the same near-duplicate marker used elsewhere (`sourceMetadata.nearDuplicateOf` / `nearDuplicateScore`), so the dashboard's yellow "Duplicate" chip with Keep/Archive actions surfaces it for a human decision. Neither the new task nor its live siblings are moved to `archived` or deleted automatically.
  - **`true`** (legacy behavior, opt-in): only the later/new task is archived as `auto-resolved-duplicate`; its live siblings remain intact.

Ghost-bug preflight is unaffected by `autoArchiveDuplicateTasksEnabled` — it is a distinct heuristic and always auto-archives on a definitive non-repro.

Both heuristics are **fail-open**: probe/detection errors, timeouts, or inconclusive signals do not block normal intake — the task continues in the regular flow.

Tombstone-resurrection blocking (including a same-agent near-duplicate of a soft-deleted task within the sticky window) is shared by every task-create backend and is **not** gated by `autoArchiveDuplicateTasksEnabled` — it always throws `TombstonedTaskResurrectionError` regardless of the setting.

Activity + run-audit event types:

- `task:auto-archived-ghost-bug`
- `task:auto-archived-duplicate` — emitted for both outcomes of the same-agent duplicate heuristic; the flag-only (default) path sets `metadata.source: "same-agent-flagged"` to distinguish it from the legacy auto-archive outcome.

These appear in task activity history; run-audit entries are emitted where run context exists (triage/engine paths). Store-only intake paths record activity without synthetic run context.

Recovery is reversible: restore archived tasks via dashboard **Unarchive** or `fn_task_unarchive`.

#### Revert/Undo affordance (FN-7525)

Done and Archived task cards (board card inline row + context menu, the detail view, and the list context menu) expose a **Revert** action alongside Archive/Unarchive when the task has a landed commit to revert. Clicking it calls `POST /tasks/:id/revert` in `"auto"` mode:

- A clean git revert shows a success toast naming the created revert commit sha.
- A conflicting/unsupported git result opens a confirm dialog offering to create an AI-undo task; confirming re-calls the route in `"ai"` mode and surfaces the created task id (or that an undo task is already open).
- A `needsHuman` result (e.g. auto-merge is off) is surfaced as an informational/error toast, never silently forked into an AI task.

The source task's column/lifecycle is never mutated as a side effect of a revert; the Revert affordance is absent when the task has no landed commit or when the hosting surface does not support it.

### 2) Plan Mode (AI interview)

On desktop/tablet, open **Planning** from the left sidebar to start or resume a planning session. You can also hand a draft from the board quick-entry row or New Task dialog to Planning with the **Plan** action.

- AI asks clarifying questions
- AI reasoning (thinking output) is preserved and visible throughout the session — expand the reasoning toggle to review the model's analysis before answering each question or accepting the summary
- Produces summary + key deliverables
- Create one task or **Break into Tasks** (multi-task generation with dependencies)
- Summary view includes a **Priority** selector (`low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent`) so single-task creation can set priority before task creation
- Break-into-tasks mode includes per-subtask **Priority** selectors (`low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent`) so each generated task can be prioritized before creation
- Break-into-tasks descriptions are structured with subtask-specific guidance first, then a separate larger-plan context section (plus `## Planning Interview Context` when interview history exists)
- Final multi-task creation now uses a compact request payload: unchanged generated subtask descriptions stay server-side, while any edits to title, description, size, priority, and dependencies are preserved when tasks are created
- Sessions persist when the planning surface is closed or you navigate away — resume from the Planning sidebar list at any time; reasoning context is restored automatically
- Back navigation rewinds the server-side planning session to the previous answered question so you can revise earlier answers and continue from the corrected turn
- On the summary screen, **Refine Further** continues through the backend planning session (including resumed completed sessions) and waits for a real follow-up question or updated summary; it does not switch to an empty question view

### 3) Todo item → Plan Mode

In **Todos** view, each todo item includes a planning action:

- Click the planning (💡) action on a todo item
- Opens Planning Mode with that todo text pre-filled as the initial plan
- Starts an AI planning interview (clarification questions + summary)
- You can then create one task or break the plan into multiple tasks

This action starts a planning session; it does **not** immediately create a task.

For full Todo View behavior (enablement, list/item actions, API routes, and storage), see [Todo View](./todo-view.md).

### 4) Subtask Breakdown Dialog

Use the 🌳 button:

- Generate 2–5 candidate subtasks
- Shows live thinking/progress immediately while generation runs, before the candidate list is ready
- Send the run to the background or close the dialog without canceling it; use the background-session indicator to resume running, waiting, or completed breakdowns
- Drag to reorder
- Add dependencies only on earlier items
- Set each subtask's **Priority** (`low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent`) before create
- Create tasks in one action

### 5) Expanded Controls

Expand the creation panel (▼) to access additional controls:

- **Refine** (✨) — Improve the description with AI
- **Deps** (🔗) — Link existing tasks as dependencies
- **Attach** — Add image attachments
- **Models** (🧠) — Set per-task model overrides (executor, validator, planning)
- **Priority** (🚩) — Set task priority (`low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent`) before creation; the selected value is applied to the created task (it does not reset to default unless omitted)
- **Agent** — Assign an agent to the task
- **Branch settings** (`branch` / `baseBranch`) remain available in full task forms and task detail editing (not in Quick Entry)
- **Review** — Set review rigor level (None, Plan Only, Plan and Code, Full)
- **Optional workflow steps** — Enable workflow-declared optional steps for the selected workflow. The built-in coding workflow exposes **Browser Verification** here and keeps it opt-in by default.

### 6) CLI creation

```bash
fn task create "Fix API timeout handling"
fn task plan "Implement role-based access control"
fn task create "Bug" --attach screenshot.png --depends FN-002
```

### 7) Create/Enrich from Research findings

From the standalone **Research** view, each finding supports two task actions:

- **Create Task** — creates a new task with `sourceType: "research"`
- **Enrich Task** — appends/updates research content on an existing task

Research actions persist detailed output in task documents (and optional attachments), not in long task descriptions.

## Task Lifecycle

Fusion task columns:

Fusion task columns use persisted enum values as the API/filter contract. Callers use enum values such as `triage`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, `done`, and `archived`; UI labels are presentation only. In particular, `triage` is displayed as **Planning**, but `Planning` is not a valid persisted column value. Dashboard task-list API requests such as `GET /api/tasks?column=triage` return only rows whose persisted `task.column` is exactly `triage`, and invalid column values are rejected.

1. **triage** (displayed as **Planning**) — idea intake; AI writes a full plan
2. **todo** — ready for scheduling
3. **in-progress** — executor active in isolated worktree
4. **in-review** — implementation complete; awaiting finalization
   - If merge/finalization hits a terminal error, tasks can remain in `in-review` with `status: "failed"` for explicit follow-up. This state is intentionally preserved by recovery (not auto-bounced to `todo`).
   - Retry behavior splits by execution-vs-merge signals: `in-review` tasks with incomplete steps (`pending`/`in-progress`) are treated as execution failures and retried back to `todo` with `preserveProgress: true`; zero-step `in-review` tasks use `mergeRetries` as the tie-breaker (`mergeRetries === 0` or undefined → execution failure path back to `todo`, `mergeRetries > 0` → merge/finalization retry in `in-review` with merge retry state reset); tasks whose steps are all terminal (`done`/`skipped`/`failed`) also stay on the merge/finalization retry path.
   - Manual retry now clears the full persisted retry-budget counter set (`stuckKillCount`, `recoveryRetryCount`, `taskDoneRetryCount`, `worktreeSessionRetryCount`, `workflowStepRetries`, `verificationFailureCount`, `postReviewFixCount`, `mergeConflictBounceCount`, `branchConflictRecoveryCount`, `reviewerContextRetryCount`, `reviewerFallbackRetryCount`, `completionHandoffLimboRecoveryCount`, `mergeAuditBounceCount`) plus `nextRecoveryAt`; merge retry counters clear only on merge-failure/generic retry paths. `retrySummary` is recomputed from persisted counters at read time, so manual retry resets the dashboard retry badge/details back to zero immediately.
   - Persisted executor session state is resumed only when it still matches the task's current worktree context. If a retry fails with `Refusing to start coding agent in missing worktree: ...` (or the incomplete/unregistered worktree variants) and the persisted session points at stale worktree metadata, recovery clears stale session pointers and retries fresh so review retries do not reopen deleted worktree paths. Merge-active self-healing resets the exhausted session-start counter only after a guarded stale-metadata clear and increments `recoveryRetryCount` so repeated recurrences still escalate for human inspection. The same supported reset is available from dashboard retry, CLI `task retry`, and `fn_task_retry` even when the row is stuck in a merge-active status (`merging`, `merging-pr`, `merging-fix`): only the unusable-worktree session-start signature bypasses the usual merge-active status gate, and the retry clears `worktree`/`branch`/`sessionFile` while preserving step progress.
   - Merge-confirmed tasks still respect `getTaskMergeBlocker()` before the final `in-review` → `done` move. If merge is confirmed but a blocker remains (for example, incomplete steps), Fusion parks the task in `in-review` with `status: "failed"` and an explicit blocker error instead of retry-looping auto-finalization.
   - Self-healing can still auto-finalize retry-exhausted failed review tasks when it can prove their branch content already landed on the merge target, so already-merged work does not deadlock in `in-review`.
   - Repeated engine merge-queue drops now escalate to an explicit recoverable review failure: if auto-recovery hits `Auto-merge starvation:` in the task `error`, Fusion has already seen three consecutive enqueue attempts rejected by the engine merge queue. Operators can recover by clearing the failed state from the dashboard, which lets the usual unpause/clear flow re-attempt merge once the underlying queue wedge is resolved.
   - Non-recoverable state-machine errors during finalization (for example `Invalid transition: 'todo' → 'done'`) are treated as terminal review failures: recovery must not re-enqueue these tasks for merge unless task state changes prove they are recoverable.
   - FNXC:AutoMergeLifecycle 2026-07-07-12:00 (FN-7641): a **proven-merge recovery rehome** is now a recoverable state-machine transition, not a terminal error. `finalizeProvenAutoMergeTask` already verifies `hasDurableMergeProof` + `getTaskHardMergeBlocker` before requesting `done` from a stale legacy column (`todo`/`in-progress`/`triage`) via `store.moveTask(id, "done", { recoveryRehome: true, preserveProgress: true })`; the store now accepts that legacy→legacy recovery rehome (previously rejected as `Invalid transition: 'todo' → 'done'`, stranding a workspace-merge-landed card in `todo` forever — NEXT-010). Only the proven-merge `recoveryRehome` adjacency check is relaxed; the `in-review → done` merge-blocker guard and normal (non-recovery) transitions are unchanged.
   - FNXC:StateMachine 2026-07-07-12:00 (FN-7641): setting a task's `nodeId` override to the workflow's terminal `end` node never silently no-ops. With durable merge proof (`mergeDetails.mergeConfirmed === true`) it finalizes the card to `done` via the same recovery-rehome path above; without proof it returns an explicit, actionable error instead of writing the field and leaving the card unchanged (NEXT-322 / NEXT-375 / NEXT-340 — a human/agent merging the branch tip directly into `main`, out-of-band, then setting `nodeId='end'`, used to leave the card silently stuck in `in-review`). This contract is enforced once in `TaskStore.updateTask` / `node-override-guard.ts` and shared identically by the dashboard PATCH `/api/tasks/:id` route and the CLI `fn_task_update` tool.

#### Self-healing: stranded-completed-todo recovery

Fusion now enforces a recovery invariant for completed work that is accidentally returned to `todo`:

- `todo` tasks with all steps terminal (`done`/`skipped`), no active execution, and no unrecoverable error are auto-promoted by self-healing.
- Promotion always respects the transition table (`todo → in-progress → in-review`) via `TaskStore.moveTask()`; no direct `todo → in-review` mutation is used.
- Review Level `0` tasks are finalized to `done` by the existing no-op review finalization flow after promotion to `in-review`; Review Level `>0` tasks remain in `in-review` for normal review/merge handling.

This is a forward-safety guard for stranded completed tasks. See FN-4055/FN-4079 for deeper lifecycle root-cause and operational repair work.

#### In-review stall signal

Fusion now derives `task.inReviewStall` for non-paused `in-review` tasks when a known stuck-state shape is detected. This signal is state-based (not log-heuristic) and is computed server-side on task hydration.

`InReviewStallCode` values:
- `transient-merge-status-no-owner` — task is still in `merging`/`merging-pr`/`merging-fix` after the stale-merging age threshold, but no active merger owns it. `recoverStaleMergingStatus()` clears this stamp and re-enqueues auto-merge-eligible, non-workspace, non-`mergeConfirmed` **unpaused** tasks. Paused tasks never re-enqueue; the sole clear-only exception is the engine-owned `merge-deadlock-detected` hold, whose status-preserving park can otherwise retain an orphan stamp indefinitely. Explicit human, approval, and unknown pauses remain intentionally suppressed. The signal itself remains diagnostic-only.
- `merge-retries-exhausted` — `mergeRetries` reached the auto-merge retry cap without `mergeDetails.mergeConfirmed === true`.
- `no-worktree-no-merge-confirmed` — task has no worktree path and merge is not confirmed (excluding explicit no-op merges).
- `merge-blocker` — `getTaskMergeBlocker()` reports a merge/finalization blocker.

Invariant: `inReviewStall` is **diagnostic-only**. It must never be used as an auto-completion trigger.

Self-healing surfaces this diagnosis via task log entries in the form:
- `In-review stall surfaced [<code>]: <reason>`

These entries are rate-limited per `(task, code)` over `taskStuckTimeoutMs`, so unchanged stalls are not spammed every cycle while state transitions can still surface a new code immediately.

**Dashboard surface:** In-review, non-paused tasks with `inReviewStall` set show a `Stall` badge on `TaskCard` and a code-specific diagnostic row in `TaskDetailModal` above the PR section. The diagnostic row includes headline/description/action copy, raw reason text, observed timestamp, and a `View activity log` deep-link that switches to Logs → Activity and highlights the most recent matching `In-review stall surfaced [<code>]: <reason>` entry. This UI is diagnostic only: neither the badge nor the jump button mutates task state.

#### Stale paused review signal

Fusion now derives `task.stalePausedReview` for paused `in-review` tasks whose review-column age is at/over `stalePausedReviewThresholdMs` (age source: `columnMovedAt ?? updatedAt`) while merge is still unconfirmed (`mergeDetails.mergeConfirmed !== true`).

`StalePausedReviewCode` values:
- `stale-paused-review`

Invariant: `stalePausedReview` is **diagnostic-only**. It never auto-unpauses, retries, archives, or moves tasks.

Self-healing surfaces this diagnosis via task log entries in the form:
- `Stale paused review surfaced [<code>]: paused <duration>; disposition options — unpause, retry, archive, or create follow-up task. pausedReason=<reason|none>`

These entries are rate-limited per `(task, code)` over `stalePausedReviewThresholdMs` so unchanged paused-review debt is visible without log spam.

**Dashboard surface:** paused `in-review` tasks with `stalePausedReview` set show a `Paused stall` badge on `TaskCard`, a diagnostic row in `TaskDetailModal` (age/threshold/observed timestamp + disposition copy + `View activity log` jump), and a `Stale paused review` list filter that narrows to tasks where `task.stalePausedReview != null`.

Disposition options:
- Unpause
- Retry
- Archive
- Create follow-up task

#### Task age staleness signal

Fusion now derives `task.ageStaleness` for tasks in `in-progress` and `in-review` (including paused tasks). Age is computed from `columnMovedAt` and falls back to `updatedAt` when needed.

Signal levels:
- `warning`
- `critical`

Threshold settings:
- `staleInProgressWarningMs` (default `4h`)
- `staleInProgressCriticalMs` (default `24h`)
- `staleInReviewWarningMs` (default `24h`)
- `staleInReviewCriticalMs` (default `72h`)

`0` or `undefined` disables that level.

Invariant: `ageStaleness` is **diagnostic-only**. It never moves, retries, pauses/unpauses, or auto-finalizes tasks.

Scheduler-side reporting emits structured, rate-limited task-log and engine-log entries in this exact form:
- `Stale task age threshold crossed [<level>]: column=<column> paused=<bool> ageMs=<n> warningThresholdMs=<n> criticalThresholdMs=<n>`

**Dashboard surface:** tasks with `ageStaleness` show a stale badge on `TaskCard`, a diagnostic row in `TaskDetailModal`, and the list view provides a `Stale only` filter that narrows to tasks with a live signal.

Success metric: maintainers can find all stale cards from the board UI in under 30 seconds.

Auto-completion/finalization remains owned by existing recovery passes:
- `recoverStaleMergingStatus` — reconciles unowned aged merge stamps. It may clear the stamp on an engine-owned `merge-deadlock-detected` pause but never resumes, unpauses, moves, finalizes, or enqueues a paused card.
- `finalizeNoOpReviewTasks`
- `recoverMergeableReviewTasks`
- `recoverAlreadyMergedReviewTasks`
5. **done** — merged/finalized
6. **archived** — preserved history, optionally cleaned from filesystem

### Archive worktree cleanup

Archiving a single-repository task synchronously removes its git worktree before branch and task-metadata cleanup. This applies to random and pinned (`task-id`/`task-title`) names, including `fn_task_archive` and direct CLI archive commands that run without an executor. A host-scoped filesystem reservation serializes a successor's deterministic-path acquisition with archival disposal; if removal fails, the reservation is quarantined so the next acquisition can reconcile the orphan instead of colliding with it. `archive({ cleanup: false })` intentionally retains the worktree. Workspace tasks' per-repository `workspaceWorktrees` are not removed by this lifecycle yet.

Board ordering behavior:
- `todo` mirrors scheduler dispatch order: priority first (`urgent` → `low`), then oldest `createdAt` within a priority tier, then task ID as deterministic tie-break.
- `triage`, `in-progress`, and `in-review` remain priority-first with task-ID tie-breaks (`in-review` still pins merge-active statuses above non-merging tasks).
- The `done` column is recency-ordered by completion time (newest first), using `columnMovedAt` as primary and falling back to `updatedAt` then `createdAt` for legacy tasks.
- The dashboard **list view default ordering matches these same per-column semantics** until a user clicks a sortable header (manual list sorting still overrides defaults).

### Lifecycle commands

```bash
fn task move FN-001 todo
fn task merge FN-001
fn task archive FN-001
fn task unarchive FN-001
```

### Lifecycle invariants

**Paused-state normalization on reopen:** When a task is moved from `in-progress`, `in-review`, or `done` back to `todo` or `triage` (retry/requeue), Fusion clears `task.paused` and `task.pausedByAgentId` to prevent contradictory `todo + paused` or `in-progress + paused` states. A paused task in `todo` is excluded from scheduler dispatch.

**Manual cancel park (`userPaused`):** A user-initiated move from `in-progress` to `todo` (`moveSource: "user"`) sets `task.userPaused = true` and hard-cancels active executor work. Scheduler treats `userPaused` tasks as intentionally parked and will not auto-dispatch them until `userPaused` is cleared — either by explicitly unpausing the task from the dashboard or by moving it back to `in-progress`. Engine/internal requeues (`moveSource: "engine"`) do not set this flag.

**Paused-state normalization on explicit completion:** When an agent calls `fn_task_done` on a paused task, Fusion clears `task.paused` and `task.pausedByAgentId` regardless of the task's column (`in-progress` or `todo`). `task.paused` prevents new work from starting, but does not block an agent from completing in-flight work and transitioning the task to `done`. The scheduler respects `globalPause` independently.

**Global pause vs task pause:** `settings.globalPause` gates new scheduler dispatches and is checked by the `fn_task_done` handoff logic. Task-level `task.paused` is a per-task gate that blocks execution start. They are independent — a task can be paused individually even when `globalPause` is `false`, and clearing `task.paused` does not affect `globalPause`.

**Branch-conflict tripwire:** Executor tracks branch-conflict failures per task in-memory. After more than 5 `BranchConflictError` events for the same task in one executor lifetime, Fusion short-circuits recovery, marks the task `status: "failed"`, sets `paused: true`, and sets `pausedReason: "branch-conflict-tripwire"` to stop further automatic retries and suppress additional "Branch conflict recovery required" emissions for that task.

### Stranded-worktree recovery

When Fusion detects uncommitted task-attributable changes in a task worktree during a requeue/release path, it will **not** silently move the task back to `todo`/`triage`. Instead, it parks the task in `status: "failed"` so operators can recover the stranded workspace state.

Diagnostics are written to both places:

- `task.error` (task detail summary)
- task activity log entry (timeline)

Each diagnostic includes task ID, absolute worktree path, dirty-file count, and sample dirty paths.

Recovery flow:

1. Inspect the worktree: `cd <worktreePath> && git status`
2. Rescue changes as needed: `git diff` and/or `git stash push -u`
3. Clear/retry the failed task from the dashboard/CLI so it can re-enter scheduling after the workspace is safe.

### Branch metadata semantics

Task cards on the board only surface branch metadata when it is non-default/user-meaningful: they hide the conventional auto-generated working branch (`fusion/<task-id>` and suffixed variants) and hide the default merge target (`main`), while still showing custom working branches and non-default merge targets.

The board header search panel now includes two **board-only** branch filters:
- **Working branch** filters by `task.branch`
- **Target branch** filters by `task.baseBranch`

These filters apply only to board rendering (not list view). Each filter supports concrete branch values plus a **No branch** option that matches tasks where `branch` or `baseBranch` is unset. Persisted filter state remains intentionally deferred to follow-up task FN-3426.

Task branch fields are intentionally distinct:

- `task.branch` — the actual working branch used for the task worktree (for example `fusion/fn-1234` or a conflict-suffixed variant).
- `task.baseBranch` — the task's configured merge target/base branch intent.
- `task.executionStartBranch` — internal execution provenance used when scheduler/executor temporarily start from a dependency branch; this is transient and cleared during execution resets/recovery.

`PrInfo.baseBranch` is unchanged and continues to represent pull-request target branch metadata.

### Dependency reconciliation guidance

When a task was created to resolve a temporary failure state in another task (for example, a preserved `in-review/failed` merge condition), its dependency contract may become stale after recovery.

Use supported TaskStore/API paths to reconcile safely:

- Remove/replace stale dependencies through task update APIs (do not hand-edit `task.json` or PostgreSQL rows)
- Add a single comment/log entry explaining why the dependency changed
- Keep downstream blockers coherent (only tasks that still truly depend on unfinished work should remain blocked)

Completion gating treats dependencies as resolved only when the dependency task is in `done`, `in-review`, or `archived`.

Auto-merge recovery follow-up creation is deduplicated: Fusion creates at most one active (`not done/archived`) recovery task per unresolved parent failure, and merge-conflict recovery also deduplicates by active branch ownership to prevent parallel duplicate follow-ups on the same conflict branch.

### Landed-task state reconciliation (maintenance)

If a task already shipped (`column: done`) but still carries transient failure metadata (`status: failed`, `error`, `worktree`, `blockedBy`, recovery retry fields), reconcile through supported TaskStore/API paths so PostgreSQL and task JSON compatibility artifacts stay in sync.

Recommended pattern:
- Audit first (dry-run) for contradictory `done` + transient-failure state.
- Apply reconciliation with TaskStore-backed mutations (for example `moveTask(id, "done")` for done-normalization cleanup).
- Add one durable reconciliation log entry explaining why stale transient fields were cleared (avoid duplicating historical failure logs).
- Re-audit after apply and resolve or explicitly disposition any related stale follow-up tasks.

Do **not** patch PostgreSQL rows or compatibility `task.json` files directly; use a supported store/API path so both representations remain synchronized.

## Branch conflict handling

When executor branch allocation finds `fusion/<task-id>` already checked out elsewhere, Fusion fails loudly by default instead of silently renaming to sibling branches. The task is moved back to `todo` with `status: "failed"`, and logs include the conflicting worktree path, tip SHA, and stranded commits.

Fusion no longer provides a dedicated task-branch conflict CLI command. Resolve conflicting local branches/worktrees with standard git tooling, then retry the task. The legacy [`executorAllowSiblingBranchRename`](./settings-reference.md#executorallowsiblingbranchrename) setting still exists as an opt-in escape hatch for older workflows.

## Task Execution Modes

Each task has an execution mode that controls how the executor agent approaches the task:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `standard` | Full execution with complete review workflow (default) |
| `fast` | Expedited execution with minimal overhead for simple tasks |

### Fast Mode Bypassed Gates

When `executionMode: "fast"`, the following automated review/validation gates are **bypassed**:

| Gate | Standard Mode | Fast Mode |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| `review_step` tool enforcement | Available to executor agent | **Not injected** |
| Pre-merge workflow-step execution | Runs configured steps | **Skipped** |
| Custom graph pre-merge prompt/script/gate nodes | Run in selected custom workflows | **Skipped** |
| Workflow revision loop | Enabled (feedback → fix → re-review) | **Disabled** |

### Fast Mode Mandatory Gates

The bypass applies to both the legacy workflow-step path and the workflow graph executor path (including custom non-`builtin:coding` workflows). `undefined` or `null` execution mode is treated as standard mode.

The following quality gates **remain enforced** in fast mode:

| Gate | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `task_done` requirement | Agent must call `task_done()` to complete |
| Completion blocker checks | Tests, build, and typecheck from PROMPT.md still enforced |
| Post-merge workflow steps | Run as normal (merger-owned) |

### Execution Mode Matrix

| Feature | Standard | Fast |
|---------|----------|------|
| Executor agent session | Full prompt + tools | Full prompt (minus review_step) |
| Pre-merge workflow steps (legacy, builtin, and custom graph workflows) | ✅ Run | ❌ Bypassed |
| Custom graph prompt/script/gate validation nodes | ✅ Run | ❌ Bypassed |
| `review_step` tool | ✅ Available | ❌ Not available |
| Post-merge workflow steps | ✅ Run | ✅ Run |
| Completion blockers (test/build/typecheck) | ✅ Enforced | ✅ Enforced |
| `task_done()` requirement | ✅ Required | ✅ Required |

### Setting Execution Mode

Execution mode can be set during task creation or editing:

- **Via API**: Include `executionMode` field in task create/update payload
- **Via dashboard**: Select execution mode in the task creation dialog or task detail modal
- **Task detail quick toggle**: In read mode, use the inline lightning-bolt control in task metadata to switch between **Standard** and **Fast** without entering full edit mode
- **Values**: `"standard"` (default) or `"fast"`

Example API payload:
```json
{
  "description": "Simple fix",
  "executionMode": "fast"
}
```

## Task provenance and research enrichment

Agent-created tasks now show a compact **Created by agent** marker directly on dashboard task cards when creation provenance indicates agent/automation origin (`sourceType: agent_heartbeat` or `sourceType: automation`, with legacy fallback to populated `sourceAgentId`). Where available, displays should prefer `sourceMetadata.agentName` over raw `sourceAgentId`.

Research-created tasks show provenance as **Created via Research** in the task detail header and `Source: Research` in `fn task show` output.

When `sourceMetadata.findingLabel` is present, the UI/CLI include it as context; otherwise they fall back to `runId` when available.

Research enrichment uses a canonical per-run document key:

- `research-{sanitizedRunId}`

Repeated enrichment from the same run writes new revisions to that same key (no sibling keys for the same run). Optional exported artifacts can also be attached to the task; duplicate attachment records are skipped unless an explicit replacement path is used.

Research document content appears in the existing **Documents** tab in Task Detail. Optional artifacts appear in existing task attachments.

## Task Detail Modal (Dashboard)

The task detail modal exposes multiple tabs.

In read mode, task metadata includes lightweight inline controls: priority can be changed from the priority chip, and execution mode can be toggled with a one-click lightning-bolt fast-mode button (Fast ↔ Standard) without opening full edit mode. These controls are intentionally aligned as a paired row (matched control height, baseline alignment, and mobile-safe wrapping) so frequent priority/mode changes stay quick and visually consistent.

Task metadata also shows compact `Created` / `Updated` timestamps: recent values render as relative time (`just now`, `Xm`, `Xh`, `Xd`) and older values switch to short month/day dates; both timestamps stay on one row across desktop and mobile widths for a compact metadata presentation.

Task settings edited from the modal now auto-save as you edit (change/blur with debounce for text-like fields). This includes title, description, dependencies, working/base branch (`branch`/`baseBranch`), workflow-step selection, model overrides in the edit form, and source issue metadata. In shared create/edit task forms, the GitHub Tracking controls are placed at the bottom of **More options** after **Workflow Steps**. The footer Save button remains available, but normal field edits no longer depend on a manual save click.

The edit footer shows inline autosave state (saving/saved/error), and successful saves propagate the returned task through `onTaskUpdated` so open detail/list state stays fresh.

The task detail modal exposes multiple tabs:

- **Details** — primary metadata and description
- **Steps** — progress across plan/implementation steps
- **Log** — task event history
- **Changes** — merge diff/change summary
- **Workflow** — workflow step results (pass/fail/skip)
- **Review** — actionable feedback surface (PR reviews/threads or reviewer-agent findings), manual refresh controls, and same-task revision actions for selected items
- **Stats** — execution timing + token usage breakdown
  - `Total execution time` prefers cumulative active runtime (`cumulativeActiveMs` + live in-progress segment)
  - `executionStartedAt` is a current-attempt anchor and may reset on reopen bounces; cards no longer rely on it alone for lifetime runtime
  - `firstExecutionAt` is the immutable first-dispatch wall-clock anchor; `executionCompletedAt` remains first-time-reaching-done
  - Task Detail also shows `Wall-clock since first execution` when it differs from active runtime (for bounced/reopened tasks)
  - Fallback order for legacy tasks: `timedExecutionMs` when present, otherwise `[timing]` log sum + workflow runtime
  - Workflow runtime is shown as a separate metric and is not double-counted into totals when `timedExecutionMs` is already available
- **Comments** — collaboration thread + steering controls
- **Model** — per-task model overrides and thinking level

## `PROMPT.md` Plan Structure

After planning, each task gets a structured `PROMPT.md` with sections like:

- Before → after transformation summary
- Mission
- Dependencies
- Context to read first
- File scope
- Steps
- Acceptance criteria
- Guardrails / Do NOT list
- Build/test/typecheck requirements

This file is the contract for execution and review.

## Task Comments vs Steering Comments

- **Task comments** (`fn task comment`) are general collaboration notes.
- **Review tab feedback** is dedicated actionable review input (PR review data in pull-request mode, reviewer-agent findings in direct/non-PR mode) used to request same-task revisions.
- Review data is served from task-scoped API endpoints: `GET /api/tasks/:id/review` and `POST /api/tasks/:id/review/refresh`.
- Both endpoints return one normalized contract (`TaskReviewData`) with stable per-item `itemId` values and `sourceMode` (`pull-request` or `reviewer-agent`) so Review UI and per-item progress can share one read model.
- The Review tab supports **manual refresh** without closing/reopening Task Detail:
  - Pull-request mode refreshes live GitHub-backed review decision/thread/comment state and updates PR metadata freshness.
  - Direct/non-PR mode refreshes normalized reviewer-agent feedback from persisted task review artifacts and does not call GitHub.
- In direct/non-PR auto-merge mode, the Review tab shows parsed reviewer-agent feedback with explicit loading/error/empty states instead of sending users to raw comments or agent logs.
- Review item bodies render markdown by default, and users can switch between **Markdown** and **Plain** modes from the Review tab action bar; the preference persists locally per user.
- **Comments remains the general discussion surface**; Review remains the actionable review surface.
- **Steering comments** (`fn task steer`) are execution guidance for the running agent.

Steering comments can be injected mid-run into active executor sessions.

When users select review items and trigger **Request revision** from the Review tab, Fusion starts an in-place same-task AI revision pass (no refinement child task):

- Review addressing progress is persisted per selected item in task state, including a durable snapshot and lifecycle timestamps.
- Each selected item transitions through `queued` → `in-progress` → `addressed`/`failed`, so Review progress survives refreshes and reloads even if upstream review data changes.
- Persisted snapshots are rendered in the Review tab when the original source item is no longer present, while Comments remains dedicated to general discussion.

- `in-progress` tasks receive compact steering guidance from the selected review items and continue on the same task/branch/worktree context.
- `in-review` tasks are resumed back to `in-progress`, reopen the last completed step, and keep same-task branch/worktree context for the revision pass.
- Assigned immediate-response agents are woken on-demand only when there is no active session; otherwise guidance is injected without forcing a new wake.

### User comments and triage re-consideration

User comments can trigger **re-triage** for already-planned but non-executing work:

- `triage` + `awaiting-approval` → user comment sets `status: "needs-replan"`
- `triage` or `todo` with a real (non-bootstrap-stub) `PROMPT.md` → user comment sets `status: "needs-replan"`
- `triage` or `todo` with only bootstrap-stub/unplanned prompt content → no re-triage transition

Execution ownership is preserved for active work:

- User comments on `in-progress` and `in-review` tasks do **not** re-route those tasks back through triage.
- Agent/system comments do **not** trigger comment-driven re-triage.

This is distinct from steering comments: steering feedback targets the currently running executor session, while comment-driven re-triage requests a fresh specification pass for planned work.
## Refinement Tasks

`fn task refine <id>` creates a new planning task that depends on the original done/in-review task.

Example:

```bash
fn task refine FN-042 --feedback "Add explicit rollback tests for partial failure"
```

Behavior:

- New title format: `Refinement: <source label>`
- New task depends on source task
- Created in `planning`
- Refinement tasks inherit the source task's GitHub tracking state (unlinked sources opt out; linked sources inherit `enabled` and optional `repoOverride`, but never copy the source issue link)

## Archive and Restore

### Archive behavior

- `fn task archive <id>` moves any live-board task (`triage`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, or `done`) to `archived`; tasks already in `archived` are rejected.
- Archive records the task's `preArchiveColumn` so restore can return to the original live column instead of always assuming `done`.
- Dashboard delete confirmations for live tasks include an **Archive Instead** action so users can preserve history without soft-deleting the task.
- Archived tasks can also be deleted from the dashboard/API/CLI. Deleting an archived task removes the archived snapshot from lists and search, but first materializes the normal soft-delete tombstone so the task ID remains reserved unless the operator explicitly chooses allow-resurrection behavior.
- Cleanup mode can persist compact metadata and remove the task directory
- Archived tasks remain read-only for ordinary task log/document writes:
  - `logEntry()` throws `Task <id> is archived — logging is read-only`
  - `upsertTaskDocument()` and `deleteTaskDocument()` reject archived parents
  - `fn_task_log` returns `ERROR: Cannot log to archived task — this task is read-only`
  - task-bound and chat/planning `fn_task_document_write` continue to use ordinary upsert and cannot publish archived corrections
- Direct reads of a retained named document and its revisions remain available for historical evidence, while list/global document registries stay live-only.
- The sole immutability exception is authenticated operator HTTP `POST /api/tasks/:id/documents/:key/archived-publications`. It can only append `"\n\n" + appendContent` after matching mandatory revision/hash CAS against a consistent PostgreSQL tombstone plus archive snapshot. It cannot replace content or metadata, restore/move/update the task, change archive/mission/link state, emit citations/task events, or wake execution. Fusion launched with `--no-auth` rejects this capability.

### Cleanup behavior

- Archived entries are persisted as compact snapshots in PostgreSQL cold-storage tables; legacy `archive.db`, in-main-DB `archivedTasks`, and older `.fusion/archive.jsonl` data remain migration inputs only.
- Task directory (`task.json`, `PROMPT.md`, `agent.log`, attachments) can be removed

### Compact archive entry format

Archive entries preserve key metadata needed for restoration, including:

- `id`, `title`, `description`, `priority`, `column`, `preArchiveColumn`
- `dependencies`, `steps`, `currentStep`
- `size`, `reviewLevel`, `prInfo` (primary mirror), `prInfos` (canonical linked PR list), `issueInfo`
- `attachments` metadata
- task `log`
- timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `columnMovedAt`, `archivedAt`)
- model override fields (`modelProvider`, `modelId`, `validatorModel*`, `planningModel*`)

`agent.log` content is intentionally not preserved in compact archive entries.

### Restore behavior

`fn task unarchive <id>`:

- Restores archive entry if directory is missing
- Rebuilds `PROMPT.md`
- Moves task back to its recorded `preArchiveColumn` when available, falling back to the archived snapshot's prior `column`, then to `done` for legacy archive entries.
- Logs “Task restored from archive” when recovering from compact archive entry

### Task-ID collision safety and operator recovery

- Ordinary task creation, duplicate, and refine flows now fail safely if the chosen task ID already exists in active storage or archive storage. Existing task rows/files always win; the new create attempt must retry with a fresh reservation instead of overwriting data.
- A failed create may burn a distributed reservation. Gaps in `FN-*` numbering are expected and are safer than reissuing a possibly-colliding ID.
- `config.nextId` is legacy/read-only. The live allocator state is `distributed_task_id_state.nextSequence`, reconciled on store open against live tasks, archived task snapshots, and reservation history.

If you suspect **historical overwrites from pre-FN-4044 builds**, inspect surviving evidence in this order:

1. PostgreSQL archived-task snapshots for the missing ID (then legacy `archive.db` only when auditing unmigrated data)
2. `.fusion/tasks/<id>/task.json.bak`, `PROMPT.md`, attachments, and any surviving worktree branch named for the task
3. agent run logs / task documents / activity log entries that still mention the original ID
4. git commits whose subject/body references the original task ID but no longer matches the current task metadata

Recovery/backfill guidance:

- If the original task row still exists in archive storage, unarchive or manually recreate the task from that snapshot.
- If only prompt/worktree/git evidence survives, create a replacement task with a new ID and copy over the recovered description, prompt, documents, and attachments manually.
- If both the active row and archive snapshot were overwritten, Fusion cannot reconstruct lost attachments/comments automatically; recreate them from git history, branch/worktree contents, screenshots, or external issue trackers.
- Record the incident in the replacement task so future audits understand why the task ID and commit history diverge.

## Reverting Done/Archived tasks (git path + AI-undo fallback)

- `POST /api/tasks/:id/revert` (FN-7523) reverts a **Done** or **Archived** task's landed work via git. Only `done`/`archived` tasks are revertable; the source task's column/status is never mutated as a side effect.
- The engine resolves the task's attributable commit(s) (squash single-commit, rebase/cherry-pick trailer-filtered subset, or lineage-snapshot fallback), performs a non-committing dry-run to classify the outcome, and only writes a real commit when the dry-run is clean.
- The route accepts an optional request body `{ mode?: "git" | "ai" | "auto" }` (default `"auto"`; unknown values reject with 400):
  - `"git"` — the FN-7523 git-only behavior. The result (including a conflicting/unsupported result) is returned as-is and never creates a follow-up task.
  - `"ai"` — skip git entirely and always create the AI-undo fallback task (FN-7524).
  - `"auto"` — try git first. A clean/alreadyReverted/needsHuman result is returned unchanged. A conflicting or unsupported result falls back to creating the AI-undo task.
- Also accepts an optional `{ granularity?: "squash" | "per-sha" }` field (FN-7548) that selects the git-path commit granularity: `"squash"` (default, unchanged) accumulates all attributable commits into one revert commit; `"per-sha"` creates one attributed revert commit per original sha (each with its own `Fusion-Task-Id` trailer and audit line), skipping no-op shas without empty commits. A mid-batch conflict in either mode rolls back the whole batch — no partially-landed per-sha commits. This field only affects the single-repo git path and is ignored when `mode` resolves to `"ai"` or the task is a workspace task.
- Git-path response contract (additive only): `{ mode: "git", clean, revertCommitSha?, revertCommitShas?, conflicts?, alreadyReverted?, unsupported?, needsHuman?, reason? }`. A clean revert lands a `revert(FN-xxxx): ...` commit carrying a `Fusion-Task-Id` trailer on the resolved base branch; `revertCommitShas` reports every commit created (all of them for `per-sha`, the single one for `squash`) alongside the existing `revertCommitSha`.
- AI-undo response contract: `{ mode: "ai", createdTaskId: "FN-YYYY", alreadyOpen?: true }`. The created task is an ordinary `triage`-column board task (via the normal `store.createTask` path) that references the source task's id, mission, and landed files, and instructs undoing the source task's behavior while preserving unrelated later changes to the same files, using a `revert(FN-xxxx): ...` commit convention. It carries NO dependency on the (already done/archived) source task. A `sourceMetadata.revertOf` marker makes repeated fallback calls idempotent — while an AI-undo task for that source is still open, a further call returns the same `createdTaskId` with `alreadyOpen: true` instead of creating a duplicate; a prior undo task that itself reached `done`/`archived` does not suppress a fresh one.
- **Workspace (multi-repo) tasks (FN-7547):** tasks with `workspaceWorktrees` populated (`isWorkspaceTask`) are revertable too — the route dispatches to a dedicated workspace path that reasons about every sub-repo's integration branch as ONE all-or-nothing unit. It resolves each sub-repo's attributable commit(s), dry-run classifies every sub-repo first, and only commits a `revert(FN-xxxx): ...` commit on EACH sub-repo when every sub-repo classifies clean/already-reverted; if any sub-repo conflicts, no sub-repo is committed and every touched sub-repo worktree is rolled back to its pre-call state. Response contract for workspace tasks: `{ mode: "git", clean, workspace: { repos: [{ repo, classification, revertCommitSha?, conflicts?, alreadyReverted? }] }, conflicts?: {repo, file, ...}[] }`. A conflicting workspace result still falls back to the AI-undo task under `"auto"` mode, same as a single-repo conflicting result.
- **`autoMerge:false` PR-based revert (FN-7554):** for a single-repo task whose git revert classifies **clean**, `autoMerge:false` no longer dead-ends at `needsHuman`. The route prepares a dedicated `fusion/revert-<id>` branch off the resolved base branch (via the engine's `prepareRevertPrBranch`, which NEVER writes to the base branch itself), pushes it, and opens a GitHub PR through the same owner/repo resolution, `githubRateLimiter` gate, `findPrForBranch` idempotency, and `manual: true` handoff as `POST /tasks/:id/pr/create`. Response: `{ mode: "pr", clean: true, prUrl, prNumber, revertBranch, existingPr? }` — a second call while the PR is still open links the existing PR (`existingPr: true`) instead of re-pushing. GitHub unconfigured or rate-limited still degrades gracefully to `{ mode: "git", needsHuman: true, reason }`, and a conflicting/unsupported/already-reverted classification is unaffected (no PR is opened; `"auto"` mode still falls back to the AI-undo task on conflict/unsupported).
- **`autoMerge:false` PR-based revert extended to workspace tasks (FN-7577):** a workspace task whose git revert classifies **clean across every sub-repo** also opens PRs instead of dead-ending at `needsHuman` under `autoMerge:false`. The engine's `prepareWorkspaceRevertPrBranches` mirrors the workspace all-or-nothing classify-all contract: it dry-run classifies EVERY sub-repo first, and only prepares one `fusion/revert-<id>` branch per sub-repo (never writing any sub-repo's integration branch) when every sub-repo classifies clean/already-reverted — a single conflicting sub-repo aborts the WHOLE preparation with no branch created anywhere. The route then resolves owner/repo and checks the rate limiter for EVERY sub-repo before pushing/creating any PR (so a GitHub-unconfigured or rate-limited sub-repo degrades the whole task to `needsHuman` rather than opening a partial subset), then opens one PR per sub-repo reusing FN-7554's per-sub-repo `findPrForBranch` idempotency and `manual: true` handoff. Response: `{ mode: "pr", clean: true, workspace: { repos: [{ repo, revertBranch, prUrl, prNumber, existingPr? }] } }`. Existing `{ mode: "git" | "ai" | "pr" }` shapes, the `autoMerge:true` workspace path, and FN-7554's single-repo path are unchanged.
- **Dashboard auto-linking (FN-7555):** the AI-undo task's card shows an "Undo of FN-xxxx" chip and its detail view shows a clickable "Created to undo FN-xxxx" link back to the source task. The source task's detail view shows an "Undo task: FN-YYYY" link whenever an OPEN undo task referencing it exists in the loaded tasks (matching `TaskStore.findOpenRevertTaskForSource`'s open-only semantics — a `done`/`archived`/soft-deleted undo task is never surfaced as active). Both directions are derived client-side from `sourceMetadata.revertOf`; no new API. A dedicated Done/Archived card revert-trigger action is still a separate follow-up (see FN-7525).
- **Configurable AI-undo workflow default (FN-7556, UI: FN-7578):** the project setting `aiUndoTaskWorkflowId` (default `builtin:review-heavy`) selects the workflow applied to every AI-undo task created above (`mode:"ai"` and the `auto`/workspace conflict fallbacks all share one creation seam, so all three inherit this default) — a stricter review posture is warranted because these tasks reverse already-shipped code. A blank/unset value means the created task inherits the project default workflow (pre-FN-7556 behavior); the route falls back to inherit (with a logged warning) if the configured id is blank or does not resolve to a real workflow, so a misconfigured id never breaks AI-undo task creation. Editable from **Settings → General → AI-undo task workflow** (choose "Inherit project default workflow" to store the blank/inherit sentinel). See [Settings Reference → Project Settings](./settings-reference.md#project-settings).


## GitHub Issue Import and PR Creation

GitLab enablement, instance/API URL, and access-token configuration are available in Settings for GitLab.com and self-managed GitLab (`gitlabEnabled`, `gitlabInstanceUrl`, optional `gitlabApiBaseUrl`, `gitlabAuthToken`, `gitlabAuthTokenType`). Fusion accepts personal, project, and group access tokens for GitLab HTTP API import tasks; read-only project issue, group issue, and merge request imports require `read_api` or `api`, while later write actions such as comments and auto-close require `api`.

GitLab imports are HTTP API only and do not require or invoke `glab`. They require effective `gitlabEnabled !== false`; when GitLab is disabled, dashboard/API/CLI/pi import fetches fail clearly before making GitLab network calls, while saved URL/token settings and existing linked GitLab metadata remain visible for re-enable. Operators can import project issues, group issues, and project merge requests from the Import Tasks surface, CLI, or pi extension tools. Imported tasks are created in `triage`, include the GitLab body (or `(no description)`) plus `Source: <web_url>`, and persist `source.sourceType: "gitlab_import"`, `source.sourceMetadata.provider: "gitlab"`, `resourceType` (`project_issue`, `group_issue`, or `merge_request`), instance/API URL, project/group identity, IID, and web URL. Group issue imports preserve the originating project identity from GitLab so duplicate detection is project-aware instead of group-path-only. Merge request imports use MR IID as the visible number and a namespaced external ID so they do not collide with issue imports.

Duplicate detection checks existing non-archived task provenance and source URLs before creating another GitLab-imported task. GitLab lifecycle side effects (completion comments, close/reopen, close-on-delete, source closed-at backfill, and tracking refreshes) also require GitLab to be enabled; when disabled they skip network work with task-log diagnostics instead of clearing source metadata. GitLab linked tracking display, comments/notes, auto-close/reopen, Command Center signals/analytics, research/search support, and any GitLab-star prompt remain out of scope until the later GitLab parity tasks mapped in [GitLab Parity Inventory](./gitlab-parity-inventory.md).

Linear issue import is available through the bundled **Linear Import** plugin, not the core GitHub/GitLab Import Tasks implementation. Operators enable the plugin from Plugin Manager, configure the plugin-owned Linear API key, then use the plugin dashboard view or plugin tools to browse and import issues. Imported Linear tasks are created in `triage`, include the Linear body (or `(no description)`) plus `Source: <url>`, and persist `sourceIssue.provider: "linear"` plus `source.sourceMetadata.provider: "linear"` with stable issue id, identifier, URL, team, state, assignee, and timestamps where available. Duplicate detection checks existing non-archived Linear provenance by issue id, identifier, and source URL before task creation and reports the existing task id when a duplicate is found.

Import issues:

- GitHub-imported tasks retain typed source issue metadata (`sourceIssue.provider/repository/externalIssueId/issueNumber/url`), which executor and merger flows use to include `Ref: owner/repo#N` in commit bodies.
- When `githubCloseSourceIssueOnDone` is enabled (default: `false`), Fusion also closes linked source-imported GitHub issues with `state_reason: completed` when the task moves into `done`. On startup, a bounded reconciliation sweep checks done tasks and closes any still-open source issue links that were missed due to transient failures.
- When triage splits an imported GitHub task into subtasks and closes the parent, Fusion comments on each affected source/tracking issue with the parent and child task IDs immediately before closing it. A source and tracking link to the same issue have one deterministic owner, so that issue receives exactly one comment and one close; different issues each receive one of both. The `task:deleted` run-audit row records only `closureKind` and `closureChildTaskIds` (no comment prose). This notification is delivered by the deleting store's in-process event; PostgreSQL does not support cross-process observation of `task:deleted` through the legacy SQLite polling path.
- GitLab mirrors this split-close handoff for resolved project issues: it posts one note naming the parent and unique child task IDs, then closes that same issue only after the note succeeds. Empty child lists do nothing, duplicate IDs retain their first occurrence, and merge requests are never auto-closed.
- Deleting a task linked to a GitLab issue outside a split closes that issue by default. Callers can pass `githubIssueAction: "leave"` to opt out; `"delete"` safely degrades to closing because Fusion never hard-deletes GitLab issues. GitLab merge requests are never auto-closed by task deletion. This delete behavior is independent of `gitlabCloseSourceIssueOnDone`, which controls only task-moved done-close behavior.

```bash
fn task import owner/repo --labels bug --limit 20
fn task import owner/repo --interactive
```

Create PR for an `in-review` task:

```bash
fn task pr-create FN-120 --title "Fix flaky auth flow" --base main
```

Manual/non-auto-merge behavior:
- Task PR branches use `fusion/<task-id-lower>`.
- In the dashboard task detail modal (`in-review`), the existing primary footer action can manually drive PR-first completion when `mergeStrategy: "pull-request"` and `autoMerge: false`:
  - `Start PR Review` (no PR linked yet)
  - `Check PR Status` (open PR linked; refreshes PR status from GitHub, does not prompt merge)
  - `Finish & Close` (PR already merged)
- Manual PR creation first checks for an existing PR on that branch and links it when found.
- If no PR exists, Fusion pushes the task branch to `origin` before creating the PR.
- In the dashboard Create-PR modal, if preflight detects merge conflicts with the selected base branch, you can choose **Resolve conflicts with AI**. Fusion resolves the task branch in-place, commits the result, pushes the updated branch to `origin`, and then lets you retry PR creation.
- When buffered actionable PR feedback exists on a PR that is already merged/closed and the task leaves `in-review`, Fusion creates a dependency-linked follow-up task in `triage` so feedback is not stranded.

## GitHub Tracking Issues

GitHub tracking issues are optional issues Fusion can create from Fusion tasks. They are **not** the same as imported source issues (`issueInfo` / `sourceIssue`): imported issues represent an existing GitHub issue that created the task, while tracking issues are new GitHub issues opened to track a Fusion task.

### Agent- and tool-created task coverage

When task creation runs with tracking enabled, Fusion attempts issue creation via a **universal post-create hook** (`setTaskCreatedHook`) that fires for every task-creation path: dashboard HTTP routes, pi extension tools (`fn_task_create`, `fn_task_import_github*`, `fn_delegate_task`), CLI commands (`fn task add`, `fn task duplicate`, `fn task refine`), mission/feature triage, automation `create-task` workflow steps, agent-driven delegation, routine/cron-created tasks, and subtask creation paths. Dashboard REST API coverage explicitly includes `POST /api/tasks`, `POST /api/tasks/:id/duplicate`, `POST /api/tasks/:id/refine`, and `POST /api/subtasks/create-tasks`. The hook is registered once per process entrypoint by calling `registerGithubTrackingHook()` at startup before any reachable `store.createTask` path. See the FN-5057 audit matrix (task document `audit`) for the current surface-by-surface registration map and resolved `sourceType` values. The hook is best-effort and non-blocking: task creation still succeeds even if repo resolution fails or GitHub calls fail. For existing tasks, PATCH first persists any `githubTracking` mutation (enable/disable, repo override, or unlink), then evaluates whether the updated task is **enabled and still unlinked** and should trigger best-effort issue creation (including non-`githubTracking` edits). This keeps retry/create behavior consistent from Task Detail instead of relying on stale pre-patch state.

Tracking behavior is controlled per task:

- `task.githubTracking.enabled` turns tracking on for that task.
- `task.githubTracking.repoOverride` optionally forces a specific target repo (`owner/repo`).
- In the dashboard **Task Detail** modal, eligible existing tasks (`triage`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `in-review`) always show a compact GitHub tracking summary row. When tracking is currently disabled and editable, the header exposes a one-click **Enable GitHub tracking** button; linked-issue details and the rest of the tracking controls remain behind the disclosure arrow for disable/retarget flows.
- After an engine/dashboard restart, Task Detail preserves the fetched full `githubTracking` payload even when the board opened the modal from a slim task row that intentionally omitted tracking metadata.
- When a task is already tracking-enabled but still unlinked, Task Detail exposes a **Create tracking issue** action in the disclosure content (including non-editable columns like `done`) so "Issue not yet created" is not a dead-end state.
- Clearing the Task Detail repo override stores `null`, which reverts repo resolution to project/global defaults.
- Explicit task-level enablement is honored even when project/global GitHub tracking defaults are unset. If `enabled: true` and the repo resolves at task scope (for example via `repoOverride`), Fusion attempts tracking-issue creation on both create-time and eligible edit-time flows, including tasks imported from GitHub (`sourceType: "github_import"`).
- Explicit manual unlink (`githubTracking.issue: null`) does not recreate a tracking issue in that same update request, and disabling tracking does not create new issues.
- On board cards, Fusion shows both the imported-source provenance marker and tracking link when they refer to different issues. The tracking chip is hidden only when the linked tracking issue exactly matches the source issue (`owner/repo#number`) to avoid duplicate badges.

Repository resolution order:

1. Task override: `task.githubTracking.repoOverride`
2. Project default: `githubTrackingDefaultRepo`
3. Global default: `githubTrackingDefaultRepo`

When Fusion creates a tracking issue, it uses:

- Title: `[FN-XXXX] Task title`
- Body prefix: `Fusion task: FN-XXXX`
- Body content: bounded plain-text task summary snippet (not full prompt content)

When tracked tasks later move to `in-progress` or `done`, Fusion also posts a short lifecycle comment on the linked tracking issue. The `in-progress` comment stays plain-text and capped, while the `done` comment can include the merge commit SHA/subject, task branch, PR link, file-change stats, and merge timestamp when those fields are available.

When a tracked task moves into `done`, Fusion closes the linked GitHub issue with `state_reason: completed`; when it leaves `done` for an active column, Fusion reopens the issue with `state_reason: reopened`; and when the Fusion task is permanently deleted from the dashboard, Fusion now prompts for issue handling (`close`, `delete`, or `leave`). If no explicit choice is provided by API callers, Fusion preserves the legacy default and closes the linked issue with `state_reason: not_planned`.

For source-imported GitHub issues (`task.sourceIssue` / `sourceType: "github_import"`) without tracking metadata, delete now follows the same close/delete/leave prompt. The prompt references the source issue (`owner/repo#number`) and forwards the selected `githubIssueAction` through the existing delete route. For non-interactive callers that omit `githubIssueAction` (or send `"auto"`), the source-imported delete default is `close`.

GitHub authentication/settings are configured in [Settings Reference](./settings-reference.md) via `githubAuthMode` (`gh-cli` or `token`) and `githubAuthToken`.

## Completion Modes (`mergeStrategy`)

- **`direct`**: local squash-merge flow into target branch
- **`pull-request`**: PR-first completion flow via GitHub checks/reviews

Configured via settings.

## Per-Task Model Overrides

Each task may override:

- Executor model (`modelProvider` + `modelId`)
- Validator model (`validatorModelProvider` + `validatorModelId`)
- Planning model (`planningModelProvider` + `planningModelId`)
- Thinking level (`off|minimal|low|medium|high`)

Overrides are configured from the task model tab or task creation actions.

## Node Routing

Tasks execute on an effective node selected by routing precedence:

1. **Per-task node override** (`Task.nodeId`)
2. **Project default node** (`defaultNodeId` in project settings)
3. **Local execution** (no node configured)

At dispatch time, scheduler routing is persisted on the task as the snapshot pair:
- `effectiveNodeId`
- `effectiveNodeSource` (`task-override`, `project-default`, or `local`)

When a non-checked-out task's `nodeId` override changes, this persisted pair is invalidated unless the update explicitly replaces its fields. The next dispatch resolves routing again and writes a fresh snapshot pair.

### Create-time routing semantics

Cluster-aware task creation separates two routing decisions:

- **Transport node**: which node receives the `POST /api/tasks` request (can be local or proxied remote).
- **Execution target** (`Task.nodeId`): which node should run the task later.

These are intentionally independent. Routing a create request through node A does not force execution on node A unless `Task.nodeId` also points there.

### Per-task node override

You can set or clear a task override from:

- Task detail modal → **Routing** tab
- Quick/create flows that support node selection
- Bulk task actions
- CLI:
  - `fn task set-node <task-id> <node-name-or-id>`
  - `fn task clear-node <task-id>`
  - `fn task create "..." --node <node-name-or-id>`
- Pi extension tool `fn_task_update` with `nodeId`

### Active-task blocking

Node override changes are blocked while a task is active/in progress. Core validation (`validateNodeOverrideChange`) returns `reason: "task-in-progress"` and users must pause/stop or wait for completion before changing routing.

### Task detail routing summary

The Routing tab shows:

- Effective node (with health indicator when known)
- Routing source (override vs project default vs local)
- Unavailable-node policy value (`block` or `fallback-local`)
- Lock banner when routing is currently immutable for an active task

### Activity log entries

When a task is dispatched, task activity/log records include routing decisions such as:

- `Node routing resolved: <node-or-local> (source: <source>)`

Use `fn task show <id>` or task logs to inspect current node routing context.

### Examples

```bash
# Route one task to a specific remote node
fn task set-node FN-204 edge-runner

# Remove override and return to project default routing
fn task clear-node FN-204

# Create a task with node override immediately
fn task create "Reproduce flaky node error" --node edge-runner

# Inspect routing summary from CLI
fn task show FN-204
```

## Review Level

Review levels control the rigor of the review process for a task:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | None | No review |
| 1 | Plan Only | Review only the plan |
| 2 | Plan and Code | Review both the plan and implementation |
| 3 | Full | Full review with all checks |

Review level can be set during task creation (in the New Task dialog under More options) or when editing a task (in the task detail modal).

The review level affects how the reviewer agent evaluates the task but does not override workflow steps or model presets.

## Model Presets and Auto-Selection by Size

Project settings support reusable model presets:

- `modelPresets`
- `autoSelectModelPreset`
- `defaultPresetBySize` (`S`, `M`, `L`)

Users can apply presets at task creation; manual model selection can override them.

## AI Title Summarization

When `autoSummarizeTitles` is enabled and a task has a long untitled description, Fusion can auto-generate a concise title. This applies to tasks created from the dashboard/API as well as tasks created by agents and tooling flows (`fn_task_create`, delegated tasks, and triage-created child tasks). GitHub tracking now waits for the `createTask`-level summarizer (explicit or auto-attached from settings) to settle before filing, then uses that resulting title and falls back to deterministic description-derived title generation only when summarization is unavailable.

If a configured title summarizer model is stale after a pi upgrade, Fusion logs a warning naming that provider/model and retries once with automatic model resolution before falling back to deterministic title generation. Genuine AI-service failures are not masked by this retry.

## Decision-only tasks (`noCommitsExpected`)

Use `noCommitsExpected: true` for tasks where the deliverable is a decision/report, not code changes.

- Meaning: executor allows `fn_task_done` with zero commits for that task.
- Triage auto-sets it only when the task is clearly decision-shaped (e.g. "Decide whether...", "Evaluate...", "Verify...", "Audit...") with explicitly observational acceptance criteria and explicit no-code language.
- Review Level 1 coordination/routing tasks that are board-only, explicitly say not to change source, and scope only task documents/metadata can also complete without commits even if older prompts omitted the explicit flag. This fallback is intentionally narrow and exists to recover plan-only coordination work; it does not bypass wrong-worktree or wrong-branch checks.
- Ambiguous/forked tasks (e.g. "Investigate..." or "Investigate and fix if needed") leave it unset by default.
- Implementation, feature, bug-fix, source-docs, test, config, or broad investigation tasks still require commits unless they have an explicit and valid no-commit contract.
- If a legacy coordination task is stuck with `fn_task_done refused: no_commits`, prefer setting/verifying `noCommitsExpected` and re-running normal no-op finalization rather than editing storage directly.
- You can manually set/clear it in Task Detail via **No commits expected (decision-only task)**.
- Task cards show a **decision-only** badge when enabled.
- Finalization still uses the existing no-op review/merge path (`mergeDetails.noOpMerge: true`, `mergeConfirmed: true`); no synthetic merge strategy values are introduced.


### Active-time statistics

Task Detail labels this measure **Total active time**. It sums durable planning AI time (`cumulativePlanningMs`, including a live `planningStartedAt` segment) and in-progress execution time (`cumulativeActiveMs`, including a live `executionStartedAt` segment). Column dwell is wall-clock queue time and is intentionally excluded.
