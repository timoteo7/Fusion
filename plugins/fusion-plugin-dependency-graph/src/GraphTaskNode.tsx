  This card's OWN resolved column traits, threaded from the host's plugin view context.

  Defect closed here, from this component having no access to the board's vocabulary
  (a second consumer, isTaskStuck, was deleted with the stuck-tag removal):
    - The `TaskCard` rendered below is a THIRD producer of unflagged cards, after the two #3025 fixed.
      It bypasses `renderTaskCard` entirely by importing the component directly, so a host-side fix
      could not reach it; every role helper inside it read the legacy ids.

  Optional, and absent means legacy: the host omits the map for remote rows and off-board columns, and
  the degraded answer there is the documented literal rather than "this board has no such lane".

  FNXC:PluginLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-03:40 (U11 #2515 audit):
  Keyed on `column === "triage"`, this went permanently FALSE for default-lineage
  cards once U11 merged Todo into Planning and dropped the `triage` id — an
  awaiting-approval card sits in `todo` now. The node then stopped showing the
  awaiting-approval state AND fell through to `isActive`, rendering a card that is
  blocked on a human as if it were running.

  The column condition is DELETED rather than converted, because it was always
  redundant: `awaiting-approval` is written only by the plan-approval gate and the
  replan-cap park, both of which act on a card in the planning lane, so the status
  alone is the signal. Deleting it is also the only option that needs no resolution —
  this is a synchronous React render, where an IR lookup is not available.

  /*
  FNXC:PluginLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-11:50 (PR #2644 review, greptile P1):
  A STALE APPROVAL STATUS MUST NOT HIDE A RUNNING CARD. Dropping the column condition made the
  awaiting-approval signal status-only, which is right for a planning-lane card — but `awaiting-approval`
  is DURABLE, so a card that carries it into an execution lane was rendered as not-active: no active
  styling, no execution-status indicator, no current-step metadata, while it was plainly running.

  So the suppression now yields to an execution SIGNAL rather than to a column name. If the card shows
  execution activity, it is active and the stale approval status is residue; if it does not, the approval
  state is the truth. That ordering needs no IR lookup, which matters here — this is a synchronous React
  render.

  The `in-progress` literal is pre-existing and NOT on the triage bar; converting it needs the board's
  column traits, which this component is not given. Left with this note rather than half-converted.
